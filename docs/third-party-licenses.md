   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @expo/cli@0.1.5

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @expo/cli

The `@expo/cli` package is a CLI binary that should be used via `expo` like `npx expo start`.

```
npx expo
```

## Design

This CLI has the following purposes:

- Be a minimal interface for starting a local development server that emulates a production EAS Updates server. The development server is the proxy between a native runtime (Expo Go, Dev Client) and a JS Bundler (Metro, Webpack).
  - To accomplish secure manifest signing (think https/TSL/SSL for web (required for sandboxing AsyncStorage, Permissions, etc.)) we need an authenticated Expo user account. This is the only reason we include the authentication commands `login`, `logout`, `whoami`, `register`. Standard web CLIs don't have authentication commands because they either don't setup https or they use emulation via packages like `devcert`.
- Orchestrating various native tools like Xcode, Simulator.app, Android Studio, ADB, etc. to make native builds as painless as possible. `run:ios`, `run:android` commands.
- Implementing a versioned `prebuild` command that can reliably work with a project for long periods of time. Prebuild is like a bundler for native code, it generates the `ios`, `android` folders based on the project Expo config (`app.json`).
  - `npx expo config` is auxiliary to `npx expo prebuild` and used for debugging/introspection.
- Installing versioned libraries with `npx expo install` this is a minimal utility born out of pure necessity since versioning in React Native is hard to get right.

# Contributing

To develop the CLI run (defaults to watch mode):

```
yarn build
```

We highly recommend setting up an alias for the Expo CLI so you can try it in projects all around your computer. Open your `.zshrc` or other config file and add:

```
alias nexpo="/path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli"
```

Then use it with `nexpo` like `nexpo config`. You can also setup a debug version:

```
alias expo-inspect="node --inspect /path/to/expo/packages/@expo/cli/build/bin/cli"
```

Then you can run it, and visit `chrome://inspect/#devices` in Chrome, and press "Open dedicated DevTools for Node" to get a debugger attached to your process. When debugging the CLI, you'll want to disable workers whenever possible, this will make all code run on the same thread, this is mostly applicable to the `start` command, i.e. `expo-inspect start --max-workers 0`.

## Format

- Be sure to update the [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) with changes for every PR. You only need to add the message, our GitHub bot will automatically suggest adding your name and PR number to the diff.
- End `async` functions with `Async` like `runAsync`. This is just how we format functions at Expo.
- When throwing errors, always opt for `CommandError` instead of `Error` -- this helps with debugging and making the experience feel more coherent.
- Utilize the unified `Log` module instead of `console.log`.
- When logging with variables, utilize the following format `Something happened (foo: bar, baz: foz)`.
  - Avoid other formats like `Something happened: bar, foz` or `Something happened: foo=bar, baz=foz`.
- Main UI components like command names (`expo start`), arguments (`--port`), and `--help` messages should be modified internally, by the Expo team to ensure the developer experience is unified across Expo tooling. External contributions modifying these core aspects may be rejected.
- Use the `profile` utility method with the `EXPO_PROFILE=1` environment variable to measure execution time.
- Avoid globals and singletons as these make testing harder and less predictable. The only global we have (at the time of writing this) is the `isOffline` boolean.

## Environment

- Always be cautious of the transitive size of dependencies. [packagephobia](https://packagephobia.now.sh/) is a great resource for determining if a package is lean. Try to minimize adding dependencies to the CLI.
- We build the CLI using `taskr` + `swc`, this is partially inspired by Next.js' local CLI.
- The build pipeline will inline the CLI version as an environment variable that is accessible anywhere in the CLI codebase. You can access it via `process.env.__EXPO_VERSION` instead of reading the local `package.json` at runtime.
- Unlike the legacy global Expo CLI, this CLI is shipped with `expo` meaning the SDK Version is always present.
  - Reduce SDK specific tasks since only one SDK should be accounted for in a single version of `@expo/cli`.
  - The `@expo/config` method `getConfig` does not need the `skipSDKVersionRequirement` in any case since `expo` should always be installed. Ex: `getConfig('...', { skipSDKVersionRequirement: true });` shouldn't be used.
- Also unlike the global Expo CLI we can assume that node modules are always installed since this CLI should be used via a project's local `node_modules` folder.
  - This means we can't perform operations that upgrade the `expo` package as these may kill the running process. Features that need this pattern (like `expo upgrade`) should live in standalone global tools.

## Testing

There are two testing scripts:

- `yarn test`: Controlled unit and integration tests.
- `yarn test:e2e`: End to end testing for CLI commands. This requires the files be built with `yarn build`

---

- You can target a specific set of tests with the `--watch` flag. Example: `yarn test --watch config`.
- We use back ticks for `it` blocks. Example <code>it(`works`)</code>.
- If a pull request is fully self contained to the `packages/@expo/cli/` folder (i.e. no `yarn.lock` modifications, etc.) then most native CI tests will be skipped, making CI pass faster in PRs.

### Unit Testing Guidelines

- Use `nock` for network requests.
- No top level `describe` blocks that wrap all the tests in a file.
- When testing a function, pass the function to the describe instead of a stringified function name:
  - `describe(foobar, () => {})` instead of `describe('foobar', () => {})`
- Use virtual `fs` via `memfs` whenever possible.
- We have a lot of global module [**mocks**](./e2e/setup.ts) already in place, consider them when writing tests.
- GitHub Copilot can make writing tests a little less tedious.

### E2E Testing Guidelines

- E2E tests should be resilient and reliable, be sure to give them plenty of time for network requests.
- When testing locally you should attempt to reuse node modules for faster results. In the `npx expo prebuild` and `npx expo start` commands for instance, we utilize a helper method that will default to reusing a project + node_modules when run locally. This can be [toggled off](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/11a5a4d27b7e1c8e4d6ddf0401397d789d89f52a/packages/%40expo/cli/e2e/__tests__/utils.ts#L174) to bootstrap a fresh project every time.
- When bootstrapping test projects, utilize the temporary folder `os.tmpdir()` as this folder is automatically cleaned up when the computer restarts.

## Coming from Expo CLI

> TL;DR: `expo-cli` was 'make it work', whereas `@expo/cli` is 'make it right, make it fast'.

The legacy global `expo-cli` package was deprecated in favor of this versioned `@expo/cli` package for the following reasons:

- `expo-cli` was too big and took way too long to install. This made CI frustrating to setup since you needed to also target global node modules for caching.
- `expo-cli` worked for almost all versions of the `expo` package, meaning it was getting more complex with every release.
- `expo-cli` combined service commands (like the legacy `build`, `submit`, `publish`) with project-level commands like `expo start`. We've since divided services into `eas-cli` and project commands into `npx expo` (`@expo/cli`). This structure is more optimal/faster for developers since they can install/update commands when they need them.
- This CLI utilizes more Node.js standard features like `$EDITOR` instead of the custom `$EXPO_EDITOR` environment variable. Also transitioning away from `$EXPO_DEBUG` and more towards `$DEBUG=expo:*`. These types of changes make Expo CLI play nicer with existing tooling.
- The DevTools UI has been deprecated to reduce the net install size, minimize complexity, and make room for future debugging UIs (Hermes/v8 Chrome debugger).
- The `expo start:web` and `expo web` commands have been rolled into `npx expo start` as we now lazily load platforms until the device requests them.
- Other missing or beta features from `expo-cli` may still be getting migrated over to this new CLI. For a more comprehensive breakdown see the [start command PR](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/16160).

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @expo/devcert@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# expo/devcert

A fork of `devcert` with bundle size optimizations.

# devcert - Development SSL made easy

So, running a local HTTPS server usually sucks. There's a range of
approaches, each with their own tradeoff. The common one, using self-signed
certificates, means having to ignore scary browser warnings for each project.

devcert makes the process easy. Want a private key and certificate file to
use with your server? Just ask:

```js
let ssl = await devcert.certificateFor("my-app.test");
https.createServer(ssl, app).listen(3000);
```

Now open https://my-app.test:3000 and voila - your page loads with no scary
warnings or hoops to jump through.

> Certificates are cached by name, so two calls for
> `certificateFor('foo')` will return the same key and certificate.

## Options

When it installs or upgrades, devcert creates a self-signed certificate
authority (CA) which it uses to sign all certificates it creates. It will try
to register this CA with OS keychains in OSX, Linux, and Windows. However,
some HTTP clients (such as Firefox and NodeJS itself) use their own trusted
certificate list instead of the operating system's keychain. The `getCaPath`
and `getCaBuffer` options make the CA available in the `certificateFor()`
return object itself, so that these programs can choose whether to trust it.

### getCaPath

Set this option to `true` and the returned object will inlude a `caPath`
property, set to the file path of the certificate authority file. Use this
path to add the certificate to local trust stores which accept paths as
arguments, such as NodeJS's builtin environment variable
`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`..

### getCaBuffer

Set this option to `true` and the returned object will inlude a `ca`
property, set to the UTF-8-encoded contents of the certificate authority
file. Use this path to add the certificate to local trust stores which don't
use OS settings, lke the examples mentioned above.

### skipHostsFile

If you supply a custom domain name (i.e. any domain other than `localhost`)
when requesting a certificate from devcert, it will attempt to modify your
system to redirect requests for that domain to your local machine (rather
than to the real domain). It does this by modifying your `/etc/hosts` file.

If you pass in the `skipHostsFile` option, devcert will skip this step. This
means that if you ask for certificates for `my-app.test` (for example), and
don't have some other DNS redirect method in place, that you won't be able to
access your app at `https://my-app.test` because your computer wouldn't know
that `my-app.test` should resolve your local machine.

Keep in mind that SSL certificates are issued for _domains_, so if you ask
for a certificate for `my-app.test`, and don't have any kind of DNS redirect
in place (`/etc/hosts` or otherwise), trying to hit `localhost` won't work,
even if the app you intended to serve via `my-app.test` is running on your
local machine (since the SSL certificate won't say `localhost`).

### skipCertutil

This option will tell devcert to avoid installing `certutil` tooling.

`certutil` is a tooling package used to automated the installation of SSL
certificates in certain circumstances; specifically, Firefox (for every OS)
and Chrome (on Linux only).

Normally, devcert will attempt to install `certutil` if it's need and not
already present on your system. If don't want devcert to install this
package, pass `skipCertutil: true`.

If you decide to `skipCertutil`, the initial setup process for devcert
changes in these two scenarios:

- **Firefox on all platforms**: Thankully, Firefox makes this easy. There's a
  point-and-click wizard for importing and trusting a certificate, so if you
  specify `skipCertutil: true`, devcert will instead automatically open Firefox
  and kick off this wizard for you. Simply follow the prompts to trust the
  certificate. **Reminder: you'll only need to do this once per machine**

- **Chrome on Linux**: Unfortunately, it appears that the **only** way to get
  Chrome to trust an SSL certificate on Linux is via the `certutil` tooling -
  there is no manual process for it. Thus, if you are using Chrome on Linux, do
  **not** supply `skipCertuil: true`. If you do, devcert certificates will not
  be trusted by Chrome.

The `certutil` tooling is installed in OS-specific ways:

- Mac: `brew install nss`
- Linux: `apt install libnss3-tools`
- Windows: N/A (there is no easy, hands-off way to install certutil on Windows,
  so devcert will simply fallback to the wizard approach for Firefox outlined
  above)

## How it works

When you ask for a development certificate, devcert will first check to see
if it has run on this machine before. If not, it will create a root
certificate authority and add it to your OS and various browser trust stores.
You'll likely see password prompts from your OS at this point to authorize
the new root CA.

Since your machine now trusts this root CA, it will trust any certificates
signed by it. So when you ask for a certificate for a new domain, devcert
will use the root CA credentials to generate a certificate specific to the
domain you requested, and returns the new certificate to you.

If you request a domain that has already had certificates generated for it,
devcert will simply return the cached certificates.

This setup ensures that browsers won't show scary warnings about untrusted
certificates, since your OS and browsers will now trust devcert's
certificates.

## Security Concerns

There's a reason that your OS prompts you for your root password when devcert
attempts to install it's root certificate authority. By adding it to your
machine's trust stores, your browsers will automatically trust _any_ certificate
generated with it.

This exposes a potential attack vector on your local machine: if someone else
could use the devcert certificate authority to generate certificates, and if
they could intercept / manipulate your network traffic, they could theoretically
impersonate some websites, and your browser would not show any warnings (because
it trusts the devcert authority).

To prevent this, devcert takes steps to ensure that no one can access the
devcert certificate authority credentials to generate malicious certificates
without you knowing. The exact approach varies by platform:

- **macOS and Linux**: the certificate authority's credentials are written to files that are only readable by the root user (i.e. `chown 0 ca-cert.crt` and
  `chmod 600 ca-cert.crt`). When devcert itself needs these, it shells out to
  `sudo` invocations to read / write the credentials.
- **Windows**: because of my unfamiliarity with Windows file permissions, I
  wasn't confident I would be able to correctly set permissions to mimic the setup
  on macOS and Linux. So instead, devcert will prompt you for a password, and then
  use that to encrypt the credentials with an AES256 cipher. The password is never
  written to disk.

To further protect these credentials, any time they are written to disk, they
are written to temporary files, and are immediately deleted after they are no longer needed.

Additionally, the root CA certificate is unique to your machine only: it's
generated on-the-fly when it is first installed. ensuring there are no
central / shared keys to crack across machines.

### Why install a root certificate authority at all?

The root certificate authority makes it simpler to manage which domains are
configured for SSL by devcert. The alternative is to generate and trust
self-signed certificates for each domain. The problem is that while devcert
is able to add a certificate to your machine's trust stores, the tooling to
remove a certificate doesn't cover every case. So if you ever wanted to
_untrust_ devcert's certificates, you'd have to manually remove each one from
each trust store.

By trusting only a single root CA, devcert is able to guarantee that when you
want to _disable_ SSL for a domain, it can do so with no manual intervention

- we just delete the domain-specific certificate files. Since these
  domain-specific files aren't installed in your trust stores, once they are
  gone, they are gone.

## Integration

devcert has been designed from day one to work as low-level library that other
tools can delegate to. The goal is to make HTTPS development easy for everyone,
regardless of framework or library choice.

With that in mind, if you'd like to use devcert in your library/framework/CLI,
devcert makes that easy.

In addition to the options above, devcert exposes a `ui` option. This option
allows you to control all the points where devcert requries user interaction,
substituting your own prompts and user interface. You can use this to brand
the experience with your own tool's name, localize the messages, or integrate
devcert into a larger existing workflow.

The `ui` option should be an object with the following methods:

```ts
{
  async getWindowsEncryptionPassword(): Promise<string> {
    // Invoked when devcert needs the password used to encrypt the root
    // certificate authority credentials on Windows. May be invoked multiple
    // times if the user's supplied password is incorrect
  },
  async warnChromeOnLinuxWithoutCertutil(): Promise<string> {
    // Invoked when devcert is run on Linux, detects that Chrome is installed,
    // and the `skipCertutil` option is `true`. Used to warn the user that
    // Chrome will not work with `skipCertutil: true` on Linux.
  },
  async closeFirefoxBeforeContinuing() {
    // Invoked when devcert detects that Firefox is running while it is trying
    // to programmatically install it's certificate authority in the Firefox
    // trust store. Firefox appears to overwrite changes to the trust store on
    // exit, so Firefox must be closed before devcert can continue. devcert will
    // wait for Firefox to exit - this is just to prompt the user that they
    // need to close the application.
  },
  async startFirefoxWizard(certificateHost: string) {
    // Invoked when devcert detects a Firefox installation and `skipCertutil:
    // true` was specified. This is invoked right before devcert launches the
    // Firefox certificate import wizard GUI. Used to give the user a heads up
    // as to why they are about to see Firefox pop up.
    //
    // The certificateHost provided is the URL for the temporary server that
    // devcert has spun up in order to trigger the wizard(Firefox needs try to
    // "download" the cert to trigger the wizard). This URL will load the page
    // supplied in the `firefoxWizardPromptPage()` method below.
    //
    // Normally, devcert will automatically open this URL, but in case it fails
    // you may want to print it out to the console with an explanatory message
    // so the user isn't left hanging wondering what's happening.
  },
  async firefoxWizardPromptPage(certificateURL: string): Promise<string> {
    // When devcert starts the Firefox certificate installation wizard GUI, it
    // first loads an HTML page in Firefox. The template used for that page is
    // the return value of this method. The supplied certificateURL is the path
    // to the actual certificate. The Firefox tab must attempt to load this URL
    // to trigger the wizard.
    //
    // The default implemenation is a simple redirect to that URL. But you could
    // supply your own branded template here, with a button that says "Install
    // certificate" that is linked to the certificateURL, along with a more in
    // depth explanation of what is happening for example.
  }
  async waitForFirefoxWizard() {
    // Invoked _after_ the Firefox certificate import wizard is kicked off. This
    // method should not resolve until the user indicates that the wizard is
    // complete (unfortunately, we have no way of determining that
    // programmatically)
  }
}
```

You can supply any or all of these methods - ones you do not supply will fall
back to the default implemenation.

## Testing

Testing a tool like devcert can be a pain. I haven't found a good automated
solution for cross platform GUI testing (the GUI part is necessary to test
each browser's handling of devcert certificates, as well as test the Firefox
wizard flow).

To make things easier, devcert comes with a series of virtual machine images. Each one is a snapshot taken right before running a test - just launch the machine and hit <Enter>.

You can also use the snapshotted state of the VMs to roll them back to a
pristine state for another round of testing.

     "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
     exercising permissions granted by this License.

     "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
     including but not limited to software source code, documentation

     "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
     transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
     not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
     and conversions to other media types.

     "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
     Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
     copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
     (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

     "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
     the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
     to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
     submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
     or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
     the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
     means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
     to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
     communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
     and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

     designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

     "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
     subsequently incorporated within the Work.

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
     publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
     this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
     worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
     (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
     use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
     where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
     by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
     Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
     institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
     cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
     or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
     or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
     granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
     as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
     Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
     modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
     meet the following conditions:

     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
         Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

     (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
         stating that You changed the files; and

     (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
         attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
         excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
         the Derivative Works; and

     (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
         distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
         include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
         within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
         pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
         of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
         as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
         documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
         within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
         do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
         notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
         or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
         that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
         as modifying the License.

     You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
     may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
     for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
     for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
     reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
     the conditions stated in this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
     by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
     this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
     Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
     the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
     with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
     agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
     Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
     WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
     implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
     of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
     PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
     appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
     whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
     unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
     negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
     liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
     incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
     result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
     Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
     work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
     other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
     the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
     and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
     or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
     License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
     on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
     of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
     incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
     of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  - [API](#api)
      - [`color`](#color)

      - [`pad`](#pad)
      - [`fixed`](#fixed)
      - [`ifElse`](#ifElse)
      - [`provide`](#provide)

## Installation

```bash
yarn add ansi-fragments
```

## Usage

```js
import { color, modifier, pad, container } from 'ansi-fragments';

const prettyLog = (level, message) => container(
  color('green', modifier('italic', level)),
  pad(1),
  message
).build();

console.log(prettyLog('success', 'Yay!'));
```

## API

Each fragment implements `IFragment` interface:

```ts
interface IFragment {
  build(): string;
}
```

The `build` method is responsible for traversing the tree of fragments and create a string representation with ANSI escape codes.


#### `color`

```ts
color(
  ansiColor: AnsiColor,
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment for standard ANSI [colors](./src/fragments/Color.ts).

```js
color('red', 'Oh no');
color('bgBlue', color('brightBlue', 'Hey'));
color('green', modifier('bold', 'Sup!'));
```

#### `modifier`

```ts
modifier(
  ansiModifier: AnsiModifier,
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment for standard ANSI [modifiers](./src/fragments/Modifier.ts): `dim`, `bold`, `hidden`, `italic`, `underline`, `strikethrough`.

```js
modifier('underline', 'Hello', 'World');
modifier('italic', modifier('bold', 'Hey'));
modifier('bold', color('green', 'Sup!'));
```

#### `container`

```ts
container(...children: Array<string | IFragment>): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which sole purpose is to hold and build nested fragments.

```js
container(
  color('gray', '[08/01/18 12:00]'),
  pad(1),
  color('green', 'success'),
  pad(1),
  'Some message'
)
```

#### `pad`

```ts
pad(count: number, separator?: string): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which repeats given separator (default: ` `) given number of times.

```js
pad(1);
pad(2, '#')
pad(1, '\n')
```

#### `fixed`

```ts
fixed(
  value: number,
  bias: 'start' | 'end',
  ...children: Array<string | IFragment>
): IFragment
```

Creates fragment, which makes sure the children will always build to given number of non-ANSI characters. It will either trim the results or add necessary amount of spaces. The `bias` control if trimming/padding should be done at the start of the string representing built children or at the end.

```js
fixed(5, 'start', 'ERR'); // => '  ERR'
fixed(8, 'end', color('green', 'success')); // equals to color('green', 'success') + ' '
fixed(10, 'end', 'Hello', pad(2), 'World') // => 'Hello  Wor'
```

#### `ifElse`

```ts
ifElse(
  condition: Condition,
  ifTrueFragment: string | IFragment,
  elseFragment: string | IFragment
): IFragment

type ConditionValue = boolean | string | number | null | undefined;
type Condition = ConditionValue | (() => ConditionValue);
```

Change the output based on condition. Condition can ba a primitive value, which can be casted to boolean or a function. If conation or return value of condition is evaluated to `true`, the first argument - `ifTrueFragment` will be used, otherwise `elseFragment`.

```js
let condition = getConditionValue()
ifElse(
  () => condition,
  color('red', 'ERROR'),
  color('yellow', 'WARNING')
)
```

#### `provide`

```ts
provide<T>(
  value: T,
  builder: (value: T) => string | IFragment
): IFragment
```

Provides given value to a builder function, which should return `string` or fragment. Useful in situations when the output is connected with some calculated value - using `provide` you only need to calculate final value once and forward it to custom styling logic.

```js
provide(getMessageFromSomewhere(), value => {
  switch (value.level) {
    case 'error':
      return container(
        color('red', modifier('bold', value.level.toUpperCase())),
        pad(2),
        value.log
      );
    case 'info':
      return container(
        color('blue', value.level.toUpperCase()),
        pad(2),
        value.log
      );
    default:
      return container(value.level.toUpperCase(), pad(2), value.log);
  }
})
```

A node.js library to get paths to directories to store configs, caches and data according to OS standarts.

## Installation

```sh
npm install appdirsjs
```

or

```sh
yarn install appdirsjs
```

if you're using yarn.

## Usage

```javascript
import appDirs from "appdirsjs";

const dirs = appDirs({ appName: "expo" });

console.log(dirs.cache);
// /home/user/.cache/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Caches/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\expo on Windows

console.log(dirs.config);
// /home/user/.config/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Preferences/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\expo

console.log(dirs.data);
// /home/user/.local/share/expo on Linux
// /Users/User/Library/Application Support/expo on MacOS
// C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\expo
```

### Keep backward compability

Then switching from old-style dotfile directory,
such as `~/.myapp` to new, like `~/.config/myapp`,
you can pass `legacyPath` parameter
to keep using old directory if it exists:

```javascript
import * as path from "path";
import appDirs from "appdirsjs";

const dirs = appDirs({
  appName: "expo",
  // Notice usage of full path
  legacyPath: path.join(os.homedir(), ".expo"),
});

console.log(dirs.config);
// /home/user/.expo
```

A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
==========================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
the various releases.

    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                    from                                compatible? (1)

    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes

Footnotes:

(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.

(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
    is "not incompatible" with the GPL.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
direction to make these releases possible.

OR ANY DERIVATIVE THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

6. This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
breach of its terms and conditions.

7. This License Agreement shall be governed by the federal
intellectual property law of the United States, including without
limitation the federal copyright law, and, to the extent such
U.S. federal law does not apply, by the law of the Commonwealth of
Virginia, excluding Virginia's conflict of law provisions.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with regard to derivative works based
on Python 1.6.1 that incorporate non-separable material that was
previously distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the
law of the Commonwealth of Virginia shall govern this License
Agreement only as to issues arising under or with respect to
Paragraphs 4, 5, and 7 of this License Agreement.  Nothing in this
License Agreement shall be deemed to create any relationship of
agency, partnership, or joint venture between CNRI and Licensee.  This

trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote products or
services of Licensee, or any third party.

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - babel-core@7.0.0-bridge.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## babel-bridge

This repo holds what we're calling a "bridge" package that is meant to ease the
transition for libraries that use "babel-core" as a peer dependency for Babel 6.

The issue with Babel 7's transition to scopes is that if a package depends on
Babel 6, they may want to add support for Babel 7 alongside. Because Babel 7
will be released as `@babel/core` instead of `babel-core`, maintainers have
no way to do that transition without making a breaking change. e.g.

```js
peerDependencies: {
  "babel-core": "6.x"
}
```
cannot change to

```js
peerDependencies: {
  "@babel/core": "6.x"
}
```

without it being a breaking change.

### Solution

To address this, we're releasing this bridge package, to allow users to do


```js
peerDependencies: {
  "babel-core": "6.x | ^7.0.0-bridge"
}
```

then where users of this package would originally have done

```sh
npm i some-package babel-core
```

to install Babel 6, they could now do


```sh
npm i some-package babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge @babel/core
```

to install the bridge package, and install Babel 7's core.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-react-native-web@0.17.7

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-react-native-web

[![npm version][package-badge]][package-url] [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html#your-first-pull-request)

A Babel plugin that will alias `react-native` to `react-native-web` and exclude
any modules not required by your app (keeping bundle size down).

## Installation

```
yarn add --dev babel-plugin-react-native-web
```

## Usage

**.babelrc**

```
{
  "plugins": [
    ["react-native-web", { commonjs: true }]
  ]
}
```

You should configure the plugin to match the module format used by your
bundler. Most modern bundlers will use a package's ES modules by default (i.e.,
if `package.json` has a `module` field). But if you need the plugin to rewrite
import paths to point to CommonJS modules, you must set the `commonjs` option
to `true`.

## Example

NOTE: `react-native-web` internal paths are _not stable_ and you must not rely
on them. Always use the Babel plugin to optimize your build. What follows is an
example of the rewrite performed by the plugin.

**Before**

```js
import { StyleSheet, View } from 'react-native';
```

**After**

```js
import StyleSheet from 'react-native-web/dist/exports/StyleSheet';
import View from 'react-native-web/dist/exports/View';
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - babel-plugin-syntax-trailing-function-commas@7.0.0-beta.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# babel-plugin-syntax-trailing-function-commas

> Compile trailing function commas to ES5


```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
);
```

## Example

### Basic
This is an example from the [Proposal](https://github.com/jeffmo/es-trailing-function-commas).

Let's say you have this function:

```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar'
);
```

If you want to have a new parameter called `param3`, the diff output would be like that:

```diff
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
- param2
+ param2, // Change this line to add a comma
+ param3  // Add param3
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
- 'bar'
+ 'bar', // Change this line to add a comma
+ 'baz'  // Add param3
);
```
In total, you have to change 2 lines for the function declaration and 2 lines for each usage.

If you had your function defined with trailing commas:

```js
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
);
```
Adding a new parameter would only change one line in the function declaration and one line for each usage:

```diff
function clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  param1,
  param2,
+ param3, // Add param3
) { /* ... */ }

clownPuppiesEverywhere(
  'foo',
  'bar',
+ 'baz', // Add param3
);
```
In the end, your diff output will be cleaner and easier to read, it would be much quicker to add a new parameter to your functions, it also makes it easier to copy paste elements and move code around.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-syntax-trailing-function-commas
```

## Usage

### Via `.babelrc` (Recommended)

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "plugins": ["syntax-trailing-function-commas"]
}
```

### Via CLI

```sh
babel --plugins syntax-trailing-function-commas script.js
```

### Via Node API

```javascript
require("babel-core").transform("code", {
  plugins: ["syntax-trailing-function-commas"]
});
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - babel-preset-expo@9.1.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# babel-preset-expo

This preset extends the default React Native preset (`metro-react-native-babel-preset`) and adds support for decorators, tree-shaking web packages, and loading font icons with optional native dependencies if they're installed.

You can use this preset in any React Native project as a drop-in replacement for `metro-react-native-babel-preset`. If your project isn't using native font loading or web support then this preset will only add support for decorators with `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators` - this is mostly used for supporting legacy community libraries.

If you start your **web** project with `@expo/webpack-config` or `expo start:web` and your project doesn't contain a `babel.config.js` or a `.babelrc` then it will default to using `babel-preset-expo` for loading.

If you have problems with the code in this repository, please file issues & bug reports
at https://github.com/expo/expo. Thanks!

## Expo Bundler Spec Compliance

A bundler must follow these requirements if they are to be considered spec compliant for use with a **universal React** (Expo) project.

### Babel Loader

The babel loading mechanism must include the following properties on its `caller`.

#### platform

A `platform` property denoting the target platform. If the `platform` is not defined, it will default to using `web` when the `bundler` is `webpack` -- this is temporary and will throw an error in the future.

| Value     | Description             |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| `ios`     | Runs on iOS devices     |
| `android` | Runs on Android devices |
| `web`     | Runs in web browsers    |

#### bundler

A `bundler` property denoting the name of the bundler that is being used to create the JavaScript bundle.
If the `bundler` is not defined, it will default to checking if a `babel-loader` is used, if so then `webpack` will be used, otherwise it will default to `metro`.

| Value     | Description                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| `metro`   | Bundling with [Metro][metro]     |
| `webpack` | Bundling with [Webpack][webpack] |

[metro]: https://facebook.github.io/metro/
[webpack]: https://webpack.js.org/

## Options

### [`jsxRuntime`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#runtime)

`classic | automatic`, defaults to `automatic`

- `automatic` automatically convert JSX to JS without the need to `import React from 'react'` in every file. Be sure to follow the rest of the [setup guide](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/09/22/introducing-the-new-jsx-transform.html#how-to-upgrade-to-the-new-jsx-transform) after enabling this, otherwise ESLint and other tools will throw warnings.
- `classic` does not automatically import anything, React must imported into every file that uses JSX syntax.

```js
[
  'babel-preset-expo',
  {
    jsxRuntime: 'classic',
  },
];
```

This property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This flag does nothing when `native.useTransformReactJSXExperimental` is set to `true` because `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx` is omitted.

### [`jsxImportSource`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx#importsource)

`string`, defaults to `react`

This option allows specifying a custom import source for importing functions. 

```js
[
  'babel-preset-expo',
  {
    jsxRuntime: 'automatic',
    jsxImportSource: 'react',
  },
];
```

This property is passed down to [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx). This options does nothing when `jsxRuntime` is not set to `automatic`.

### [`lazyImports`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy)

Changes Babel's compiled `import` statements to be lazily evaluated when their imported bindings are used for the first time.

_Note:_ this option has an effect only when the `disableImportExportTransform` option is set to `false`. On Android and iOS, `disableImportExportTransform` defaults to `false`, and on web it defaults to `true` to allow for tree shaking.

This can improve the initial load time of your app because evaluating dependencies up front is sometimes entirely un-necessary, particularly when the dependencies have no side effects.

The value of `lazyImports` has a few possible effects:

- `null` - [metro-react-native-babel-preset](https://github.com/facebook/metro/tree/master/packages/metro-react-native-babel-preset) will handle it. (Learn more about it here: https://github.com/facebook/metro/commit/23e3503dde5f914f3e642ef214f508d0a699851d)

- `false` - No lazy initialization of any imported module.

- `true` - Lazy-init all imported modules except local imports (e.g., `./foo`), certain Expo packages that have side effects, and the two cases mentioned [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy).

- `Array<string>` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.

- `(string) => boolean` - [babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs#lazy) will handle it.

  If you choose to do this, you can also access the list of Expo packages that have side effects by using `const lazyImportsBlacklist = require('babel-preset-expo/lazy-imports-blacklist');` which returns a `Set`.

**default:** `null`

```js
[
    'babel-preset-expo',
    {
        lazyImports: true
    }
],
```

### `web.disableImportExportTransform`

Enabling this option will allow your project to run with older JavaScript syntax (i.e. `module.exports`). This option will break tree shaking and increase your bundle size, but will eliminate the following error when `module.exports` is used:

> `TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'exports' of object '#<Object>'`

**default:** `false`

```js
[
    'babel-preset-expo',
    {
        web: { disableImportExportTransform: true }
    }
],
```

 - boolbase@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

#boolbase
This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).

###WTF?

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.

###And why is this a separate module?

I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - bser@2.1.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# BSER Binary Serialization

BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON.
BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of
encoded values.

It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary
with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating
system filename storage.

For more details about the serialization scheme see
[Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).

## API

```js
var bser = require('bser');
```

### bser.loadFromBuffer

The is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer,
decodes a single value and returns it.  Throws an error if the
input is invalid.

```js
var obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);
```

### bser.dumpToBuffer

Synchronously encodes a value as BSER.

```js
var encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);
console.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']
```

### BunserBuf

The asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.
You may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the
decoded values via its `value` event.

```js
var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
  console.log(obj);
});
```

Then in your socket `data` event:

```js
bunser.append(buf);
```

## Example

Read BSER from socket:

```js
var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();

bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
  console.log('data from socket', obj);
});

var socket = net.connect('/socket');

socket.on('data', function(buf) {
  bunser.append(buf);
});
```

Write BSER to socket:

```js
socket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));
```

Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-alloc-unsafe
```

## Usage

```js
const allocUnsafe = require('buffer-alloc-unsafe')

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 78 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 05 00>

console.log(allocUnsafe(10))
//=> <Buffer 58 ed bf 5f ff 7f 00 00 01 00>

//=> <Buffer 50 0c 80 03 01 00 00 00 0a 00>

allocUnsafe(-10)
//=> RangeError: "size" argument must not be negative
```

## API

### allocUnsafe(size)

- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`

Allocates a new *non-zero-filled* `Buffer` of `size` bytes. The `size` must be
less than or equal to the value of `buffer.kMaxLength` and greater than or equal
to zero. Otherwise, a `RangeError` is thrown.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-alloc
```

## Usage

```js
const alloc = require('buffer-alloc')

console.log(alloc(4))
//=> <Buffer 00 00 00 00>

console.log(alloc(6, 0x41))
//=> <Buffer 41 41 41 41 41 41>

console.log(alloc(10, 'linus', 'utf8'))
//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73 6c 69 6e 75 73>
```

## API

### alloc(size[, fill[, encoding]])

- `size` &lt;Integer&gt; The desired length of the new `Buffer`
- `fill` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; A value to pre-fill the new `Buffer` with. **Default:** `0`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `fill` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`

Allocates a new `Buffer` of `size` bytes. If `fill` is `undefined`, the `Buffer` will be zero-filled.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Buffer Fill

A [ponyfill](https://ponyfill.com) for `Buffer.fill`.

Works as Node.js: `v6.4.0` <br>
Works on Node.js: `v0.10.0`

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save buffer-fill
```

## Usage

```js
const fill = require('buffer-fill')
const buf = Buffer.allocUnsafe(5)

console.log(buf.fill(8))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 08 08 08>

console.log(buf.fill(9, 2, 4))
//=> <Buffer 08 08 09 09 08>

console.log(buf.fill('linus', 'latin1'))
//=> <Buffer 6c 69 6e 75 73>

console.log(buf.fill('\u0222'))
//=> <Buffer c8 a2 c8 a2 c8>
```

## API

### fill(buf, value[, offset[, end]][, encoding])

- `value` &lt;String&gt; | &lt;Buffer&gt; | &lt;Integer&gt; The value to fill `buf` with
- `offset` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to start filling `buf`. **Default:** `0`
- `end` &lt;Integer&gt; Where to stop filling `buf` (not inclusive). **Default:** `buf.length`
- `encoding` &lt;String&gt; If `value` is a string, this is its encoding. **Default:** `'utf8'`
- Return: &lt;Buffer&gt; A reference to `buf`

Fills `buf` with the specified `value`. If the `offset` and `end` are not given,
the entire `buf` will be filled. This is meant to be a small simplification to
allow the creation and filling of a `Buffer` to be done on a single line.

If the final write of a `fill()` operation falls on a multi-byte character, then
only the first bytes of that character that fit into `buf` are written.

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and

     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to

     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - denodeify@1.2.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

denodeify [ ![Codeship Status for matthew-andrews/denodeify](https://codeship.io/projects/02ac77d0-1a58-0132-bf86-4a07366ee29d/status)](https://codeship.io/projects/34622)
=========

Tool to turn functions with Node-style callback APIs into functions that return [Promises](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise).

Inspired by and adapted from Q's [`Q.denodeify`/`Q.nfcall` function](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#qnfbindnodefunc-args).

Warning: This micro-library doesn't force you to use any particular Promise implementation by using whatever `Promise` has been defined as globally.  This is so that you may use any ES6 standard Promise compliant library - or, of course, native ES6 Promises.

If you're running the code on a browser or node version that doesn't include native promises you will need to include a polyfill.  The following polyfills are tested as part of this module's test suite:-
- [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake)'s [ES6 Promise library](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) (which is actually adapted from [Stefan Penner](https://twitter.com/stefanpenner)'s [RSVP.js](https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js)). -  `require('es6-promise').polyfill();`
- [Getify](https://twitter.com/getify)'s [Native Promise Only library](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) - `require('native-promise-only');`
- [ES6 Shim](https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim) - `require('es6-shim');`
- [Calvin Metcalf](https://twitter.com/CWMma)'s [Lie](https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/lie) - `global.Promise = global.Promise || require('lie');`

Note: as of v1.2.0 you can use **denodeify** in the front end.  Pull it in via CommonJS, AMD or simply add to your webpage and it'll be available on `window.denodeify`. 

## Installation

```
npm install denodeify --save
```

Or:-

```
bower install denodeify --save
```

## Examples

Simple example with [`readFile`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/read-file):-

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var readFile = denodeify(require('fs').readFile);

readFile('my-file.txt', { encoding: 'UTF-8' })
  .then(function(text) {
    console.log("My file's contents is: " + text);
  });
```

(Note: you will need to also install [es6-promise](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) with `npm install es6-promise` for this code sample to work within node versions that don't have `Promise` natively available)

More complex example with `exec`:-

## Advanced usage

You can also pass in a function as a second argument of `denodeify` that allows you to manipulate the data returned by the wrapped function before it gets passed to the Promise's `reject` or `resolve` functions, for example:-

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {

  // Throw away stderr data
  return [err, stdout];
});

exec('hostname')
  .then(function(host) {
    console.log("My hostname is: " + host.replace('\n', ''));
  });
```

Or,

```js
require('es6-promise').polyfill();

var denodeify = require('denodeify');
var exec = denodeify(require('child_process').exec, function(err, stdout, stderr) {
  return [err, [stdout, stderr]];
});

exec('my-command')
  .then(function(results) {
    console.log("stdout is: " + results[0]);
    console.log("stderr is: " + results[1]);
  });
```

Useful for functions that return multiple arguments, for example [`child_process#exec`](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback).

## Credits and collaboration ##

The lead developer of **denodeify** is [Matt Andrews](http://twitter.com/andrewsmatt) at FT Labs with much help and support from [Kornel Lesiński](https://twitter.com/pornelski). All open source code released by FT Labs is licenced under the MIT licence. We welcome comments, feedback and suggestions.  Please feel free to raise an issue or pull request.

- Follow the setup instructions for [`expo-yarn-workspaces`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-yarn-workspaces). 
- Add the following configuration to your app's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "expo-yarn-workspaces": {
    "symlinks": ["expo-constants"]
  }
}
```

- Finally, run `yarn` in the app folder to create symlinks to `expo-constants` in your app's local `node_modules` folder.

# Importing native dependencies - autolinking

Many React Native libraries come with platform-specific (native) code. This native code has to be linked into the project and, in some cases, configured further. These actions require some modifications to the native project files. One of the steps that has to be done with the native configuration is to enable the autolinking mechanism that takes care of including any supported module's native code into the project. The following configuration is required:

### iOS

> Caution! After you have made the following changes you will need to run `pod install` again.

```ruby
# Podfile

require File.join(File.dirname(`node --print "require.resolve('react-native/package.json')"`), "scripts/react_native_pods")
require File.join(File.dirname(`node --print "require.resolve('react-native-unimodules/package.json')"`), "cocoapods.rb")
require File.join(File.dirname(`node --print "require.resolve('expo-modules-core/package.json')"`), "scripts/autolinking")

#  ...

target "TargetName" do
  use_unimodules!
  config = use_native_modules!
  use_react_native!(:path => config["reactNativePath"])

  # ...
end
```

### Android

```groovy
// app/build.gradle

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('react-native-unimodules/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../gradle.groovy")
apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('react-native/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../react.gradle")
apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('expo-updates/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../scripts/create-manifest-android.gradle")

// ...

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../native_modules.gradle");
applyNativeModulesAppBuildGradle(project)
```

```groovy
// settings.gradle

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('react-native-unimodules/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../gradle.groovy");
includeUnimodulesProjects()

apply from: new File(["node", "--print", "require.resolve('@react-native-community/cli-platform-android/package.json')"].execute(null, rootDir).text.trim(), "../native_modules.gradle");
applyNativeModulesSettingsGradle(settings)
```

### Explanation

The scripts that are referenced in Gradle and Cocoapods are usually found the related package inside the project's `node_modules` directory. In the case of monorepos (such as Yarn workspaces) the project directory may not contain `node_modules` at all; instead, the modules are likely to be located at the root of the repository. In order to ensure that both cases are supported, we take advantage of the Node dependency resolution strategy. We invoke a subprocess that spawns the simple JavaScript snippet that tries to locate the desired npm package containing the script we need.

- On iOS, we use [`` ` ` `` (backtick)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3159945/running-command-line-commands-within-ruby-script) ([alternative reference](https://ruby-doc.org/core-3.0.2/Kernel.html#method-i-60)).
- On Android, we use [String[]#execute](<http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/groovy-jdk/java/lang/String[].html#execute()>) to obtain the results from the subprocess' stdout.

The Node process that is spawned runs [`require.resolve`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/modules.html#modules_require_resolve_request_options) to obtain the path to a module's `package.json`(if you look for the module location using solely module name, you'll be given the path to the file pointed by the `main` attribute from the `package.json` and we need to know the location of the module's root directory). We then assemble the path to the desired script and execute it.

You can read more about the scripts and libraries used in the examples above in their official READMEs.

## 🚀 Features

### Built-in splash screen image resize modes

`expo-splash-screen` contains a built-in feature for taking care of properly displaying your splash screen image. You can use the following resize modes to obtain behavior as if you were using the React Native `<Image>` component's `resizeMode` style.

#### `CONTAIN` resize mode

Scale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions the width and height of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.

<table>
  <thead><tr><td>Android</td><td>iOS</td></tr></thead>
  <tbody><tr>

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### `COVER` resize mode

Scale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both the width and height of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.

</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

#### `NATIVE` resize mode

> **Android only.**

By using this resize mode your app will will leverage Android's ability to present a static bitmap while the application is starting up.
Android (unlike iOS) does not support stretching of the provided image during launch, so the application will present the given image centered on the screen at its original dimensions.

> Animation above presents one of our [known issues](#native-mode-pushes-splash-image-up-a-little-bit)

Selecting this resize mode requires some more work to be done in native configuration.

### Per-appearance (a.k.a. dark-mode) splash screen

`expo-splash-screen` supports per-appearance splash screens that respond to system appearance changes on iOS 13+ and dark-mode changes on Android 10+.

### StatusBar customization

`expo-splash-screen` allows customization of the StatusBar according to the [ReactNative StatusBar API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar).

## 📚 API

```tsx
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
```

The native splash screen that is controlled via this module autohides once the ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is mounted. This means that when your app first `render`s view component, the native splash screen will hide. This default behavior can be prevented by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) and later on [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync).

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`

This method makes the native splash screen stay visible until [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync) is called. This must be called before any ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is rendered (either in the global scope of your main component, or when the component renders `null` at the beginning - see [Examples section](#-examples)).

Preventing default autohiding might come in handy if your application needs to prepare/download some resources and/or make some API calls before first rendering some actual view hierarchy.

#### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to `true` when preventing autohiding succeeded and to `false` if the native splash screen is already prevented from autohiding (for instance, if you've already called this method).
`Promise` rejection most likely means that native splash screen cannot be prevented from autohiding (it's already hidden when this method was executed).

### `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`

Hides the native splash screen. Only works if the native splash screen has been previously prevented from autohiding by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) method.

#### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to `true` once the splash screen becomes hidden and to `false` if the splash screen is already hidden.

## 🗒 Examples

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in global scope

`App.tsx`

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

// Prevent native splash screen from autohiding before App component declaration
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()
  .then(result => console.log(`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() succeeded: ${result}`))
  .catch(console.warn); // it's good to explicitly catch and inspect any error

export default class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Hides native splash screen after 2s
    setTimeout(async () => {
      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    }, 2000);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! 👋</Text>
      </View>
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',
  },
  text: {
    color: 'white',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in component that initially renders `null`

`App.tsx`

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    appIsReady: false,
  };

  async componentDidMount() {
    // Prevent native splash screen from autohiding
    try {
      await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn(e);
    }
    this.prepareResources();
  }

  /**
   * Method that serves to load resources and make API calls
   */
  prepareResources = async () => {
    await performAPICalls(...);
    await downloadAssets(...);

    this.setState({ appIsReady: true }, async () => {
      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    });
  }

  render() {
    if (!this.state.appIsReady) {
      return null;
    }

    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! 👋</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',
  },
  text: {
    color: 'white',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

## 💻 Installation in managed Expo projects

Refer to [the SplashScreen section of the Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/splash-screen/).

## 🖥 Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `expo` package](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-expo-modules/) before continuing.

## Add the package to your dependencies

```
expo install expo-splash-screen
```

## 📱 Configure iOS

Run `npx pod-install` after installing the package.

### Automatic configuration

The easiest way to configure the splash screen in bare React Native projects is with the expo-splash-screen command. See the [README](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/tree/main/unlinked-packages/configure-splash-screen) for more information, or run `yarn expo-splash-screen --help` in your project.

### Manual Configuration

To achieve native splash screen (in iOS ecosystem it's called `LaunchScreen`) behavior, you have to provide either a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file or a `SplashScreen.xib` file, and configure your Xcode project accordingly.

The guide below shows how to configure your Xcode project to use a single image file as a splash screen using a `.storyboard` file (configuration for `.xib` filetype is analogous).

1. [Add an image to `Images.xcassets`](#-add-an-image-to-imagesxcassets)
2. [Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-create-splashscreenstoryboard)
3. [Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`](#-select-content-mode-for-the-imageview-in-splashscreenstoryboard)
4. [Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen](#-mark-splashscreenstoryboard-as-the-launchscreen)
5. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode)
6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar)

#### 🛠 Add an image to `Images.xcassets`

First you need to add the image file that would serve as a splash screen to your native project's resources.

1. In your Xcode project open the `.xcassets` (often named `Images.xcassets` or `Assets.xcassets`) file.
2. In the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreen`.
3. Provide the splash screen image you've prepared (you have to provide it in three different scales).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addImagesXcassets.png" height="350" />
</details>

#### 🛠 Create `SplashScreen.storyboard`

This is the actual splash screen definition and will be used by the system to render your splash screen.

1. Create a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file.
2. Add a `View Controller` to the newly created `.storyboard` file:
   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),
   - find `View Controller` element,
   - drag-and-drop it to the `.storyboard` file.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addViewControllerToStoryboard.png" height="350" />
</details>

3. Add an `Image View` to the `View Controller`:
   - first remove other `View` element from `View Controller`,
   - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),
   - find `Image View` element,
   - drag-and-drop it as a `View Controller` child in view hierarchy inspector.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addImageViewToStoryboard.png" height="350" />
</details>

4. Set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`:
   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Identity Inspector` in the right panel,
   - and set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addStoryboardID.png" height="350" />
</details>

5. Tick `Is Initial View Controller` in `SplashScreenViewController`:
   - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - and tick `Is Initial View Controller` in View Controller section.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-tickIsInitialViewController.png" height="350" />
</details>

6. Configure `Image View` source:
   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - select `SplashScreen` in `Image` parameter).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-configureImageView.png" height="350" />
</details>

7. Configure `Background` of the `Image View`:
   - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - configure `Background` parameter:
     - To enter a `#RRGGBB` value you need to select `Custom` option and in the `Colors Popup` that appeared you need to navigate to the second tab and choose `RGB Sliders` from dropdown select.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectBackgroundColor.png" height="350" />
</details>

#### 🛠 Select `Content Mode` for the `ImageView` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`

This is how your image will be displayed on the screen.

1. Open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` from `View Controller`.
2. Navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and locate `Content Mode`.
3. Select one of the following:
   - `Aspect Fit` to obtain [CONTAIN resize mode](#contain-resize-mode),
   - `Aspect Fill` to obtain [COVER resize mode](#cover-resize-mode).
4. You can always choose other options to achieve different image positioning and scaling.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectImageViewContentMode.png" height="350" />
</details>

#### 🛠 Mark `SplashScreen.storyboard` as the LaunchScreen

The newly created `SplashScreen.storyboard` needs to be marked as the `Launch Screen File` in your Xcode project in order to be presented from the very beginning of your application launch.

1. Select your project in `Project Navigator`
2. Select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `General` tab.
3. Locate `App Icons and Launch Images` section and `Launch Screen File` option.
4. Select or enter `SplashScreen` as the value for located option.

<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectLaunchScreen.png" height="350" />
</details>

#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode

##### Provide different background colors

Depending on what iOS version your application is targeting, you have to adjust your native project differently to a obtain working per-appearance splash screen view.

##### I'm targeting iOS 11+

You can take advantage of [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) in your Xcode project.

1. Create a new `Color Set` and customize its values for different color modes:
   - in your `.xcassets` directory (either create a new `.xcassets` for colors, or reuse an existing one e.g. with images) create `New Color Set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and change `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,
   - select desired color in `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel for each mode.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-createNamedColor.png" height="350" />
</details>

2. Select created `named color` as the `Background` for the `Image View` in `SplashScreen.storyboard`:
   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,
   - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
   - configure `Background` parameter by selecting your created `named color` (that should be listed as `SplashScreenBackground`).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectNamedColor.png" height="350" />
</details>

##### I'm targeting iOS version < 11

You cannot use [`named colors`](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/WhatsNewXcode/xcode_9/xcode_9.html) feature in your Xcode project.
Instead you have to create an additional image set that contains small 1x1px images, each with the desired background color. Then, you'll use this additional image resource as a background in the splash screen view.

You can use this online generator to obtain 1x1px `.png` images with desired colors: http://www.1x1px.me.

1. Create `SplashScreenBackground` `Image Set` with desired background colors for each mode in your `Images.xcassets` directory:
   - open your `.xcassets` directory with images,
   - in the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreenBackground`,
   - convert this `Image set` to support `Dark Appearance` by navigating to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and changing `Appearance` to `Any, Dark`,
   - provide images with colors for every mode (you can generate color 1x1px images using http://www.1x1px.me).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addSplashScreenBackgroundImages.png" height="250" />
</details>

2. Update `SplashScreen.storyboard` to consist of a single top-level `View` with two `Image View` subviews (solid-colored image in the background and actual splash screen image in the foreground):

   - open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and replace `Image View` with a plain `View` (search `Library` for it and drag&drop it in place of current `Image View`),
   - add two

3. Configure first `Image View` (background color):
   - configure attributes in `Attributes Inspector`:
     - set `Image` to `SplashScreenBackground` (prepared in previous step),
     - set `Content Mode` to `Scale To Fill` (color needs to take all available space),
   - make this subview take all available space in parent view:
     - open `Add new constraints` bottom menu,
     - make sure `Constrain to margin` is not checked,
     - for every input, open the dropdown and select `View` (parent view reference) and set `0` as the value,
     - once every side is covered (`0` value and parent view reference selected in dropdown) hit `Add 4 Constraints`,
     - observe that in `View Hierarchy Inspector` constraints are added and `Image View` resized to take whole place of parent view.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-createBackgroundImageView.png" height="350" />
</details>

4. Configure second `Image View` (actual splash screen image):
   - select second `Image View` and select correct `Image` in `Attributes Inspector` alongside with desired `Content Mode`,
   - make this subview take all available space in parent view (see previous step).

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addConstraintsToImageViews.png" height="350" />
</details>

##### Provide different splash screen image

You might want to add a separate image for `dark` mode. If the system is switched to `dark` mode, it would pick this different image instead of the normal one and present it in the splash screen view.

1. In your Xcode project open `SplashScreen` (created in previous section).
2. Convert this asset to support `Dark Appearance`:

- navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
- locate `Appearances` section and select `Any, Dark`,
- provide image for `dark mode` by dropping it to the correct box.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addDarkImagesXcassets.png" height="280" />
</details>

###### Background color when you want to support iOS < 11

If you're targeting a version of iOS < 11 then you cannot use `named color` feature and instead you need to generate images with desired background colors that are going to be used as the background for splash screen view.
There is this awesome 1x1px png online generator: http://www.1x1px.me (use it to generate two 1x1px images with desired background colors for different color modes).

#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar

You might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.

1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag:

- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,
- add or modify `Status bar initially hidden` attribute with desired value.

<details>
 <summary>Show image with details</summary>
<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-statusBar-hidden.png" height="350" />
</details>

2. Customize `StatusBar style` option:

- open main project view, select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `Info` tab,
- add or modify `Status bar style` attribute with desired value.

## 🤖 Configure Android

To achieve fully-native splash screen behavior, `expo-splash-screen` needs to be hooked into the native view hierarchy and consume some resources that have to be placed under `/android/app/src/res` directory.

### Automatic configuration

The easiest way to configure the splash screen in bare React Native projects is with the expo-splash-screen command. See the [README](https://github.com/expo/expo-cli/tree/main/unlinked-packages/configure-splash-screen) for more information, or run `yarn expo-splash-screen --help` in your project.

### Manual Configuration

1. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreen_imagepng)
2. [Configure `res/values/colors.xml`](#-configure-resvaluescolorsxml)
3. [Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#-configure-resdrawablesplashscreenxml)
4. [Configure `res/values/styles.xml`](#-configure-resvaluesstylesxml)
5. [Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`](#-configure-androidmanifestxml)
6. [(<em>optional</em>) Customzine `resizeMode`](#-optional-customize-resizemode)
7. [(<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode](#-optional-enable-dark-mode-1)
8. [(<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar](#-customize-statusbar-1)

#### 🛠 Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`

You have to provide your splash screen image and place it under the `res/drawable` directory.
This image will be loaded as soon as Android mounts your application's native view hierarchy.

##### `NATIVE` mode adjustments

If you've overridden `<string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you need to do a few additional steps.

In your application's `res` directory you might want to have a number of `drawable-X` sub-directories (where `X` is the different DPI for different devices). They store different versions of images that are picked based on the device's DPI (for more information please see [this official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskProvideAltBmp)).

To achieve proper scaling of your splash screen image on every device you should have following directories:

- `res/drawable-mdpi` - scale 1x - resources for medium-density (mdpi) screens (~160dpi). (This is the baseline density.)
- `res/drawable-hdpi` - scale 1.5x - resources for high-density (hdpi) screens (~240dpi).
- `res/drawable-xhdpi` - scale 2x - resources for extra-high-density (xhdpi) screens (~320dpi).
- `res/drawable-xxhdpi` - scale 3x - resources for extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens (~480dpi).
- `res/drawable-xxxhdpi` - scale 4x - resources for extra-extra-extra-high-density (xxxhdpi) uses (~640dpi).

Each of directories mentioned above should contain the same `splashscreen_image.png` file, but with a different resolution (pay attention to scale factors).

#### 🛠 Configure `res/values/colors.xml`

This file contains colors that are reused across your application at the native level.
Update the file with the following content or create one if missing:

```diff
<resources>
+ <color name="splashscreen_background">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->
  <!-- Other colors defined for your application -->
</resources>
```

#### 🛠 Configure `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`

This file contains the description of how the splash screen view should be drawn by the Android system.
Create the file with the following content:

```diff
+ <layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
+   <item android:drawable="@color/splashscreen_background"/>
+ </layer-list>
```

#### `NATIVE` mode adjustments

If you've overridden `<string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">native</string>` mode in [`res/values/strings.xml`](#-optional-customize-resizemode), you shoulw add:

```diff
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <item android:drawable="@color/splashscreen_background"/>
+ <item>
+   <bitmap android:gravity="center" android:src="@drawable/splashscreen_image"/>
+ </item>
</layer-list>
```

#### 🛠 Configure `res/values/styles.xml`

Locate your main activity theme in `/android/app/src/res/values/styles.xml` or create one if missing.

```diff
  <!-- Main activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
+   <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item> <!-- this line instructs the system to use 'splashscreen.xml' as a background of the whole application -->
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

#### 🛠 Configure `AndroidManifest.xml`

Adjust your application's main `AndroidManifest.xml` to contain an `android:theme` property pointing to the style that contains your splash screen configuration:

```diff
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapp">

  ...

  <application ...>

+   <!-- Ensure that 'android:theme' property is pointing to the style containing native splash screen reference - see 'styles.xml' -->
    <activity
      android:name=".MainActivity"
+     android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
      ...
    >
      ...
    </activity>
  </application>

</manifest>
```

#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize `resizeMode`

The default image [`resizeMode`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#built-in-splash-screen-image-resize-modes) is [`CONTAIN`](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/%40kudo/modularize-expo-splash-screen/packages/expo-splash-screen#contain-resize-mode). If you want to have different `resizeMode`, you need to override in `res/values/strings.xml`.

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
 <resources>
   <string name="app_name">sdk42</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">contain|cover|native</string>
</resources>
```

#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Enable dark mode

##### Provide different background colors - `res/values-night/colors.png`

If you want to have different background colors in your splash screen depending on the system color mode, you need to create a similar file to `colors.xml`, but in the directory `res/values-night`.
Values in this file are going to picked by the system when it is switched to `dark` mode.

```diff
<resources>
+ <color name="splashscreen_background">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->
</resources>
```

##### Provide different splash screen image - `res/drawable-night/splashscreen_image.png`

You might want to provide a separate splash screen image for dark mode usage, and place it under the `res/drawable-night` directory with exactly the same name as the normal one.
This step is optional, because you might want to have the same image in both `light` and `dark` modes (e.g. you have just a light-themed logo and you want to have different background colors in different modes).

#### 🛠 (<em>optional</em>) Customize StatusBar

You might want to customize the StatusBar appearance during the time the SplashScreen is being shown.

1. Customize `StatusBar hiding` flag

To have the StatusBar completely hidden you need to update your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry (to prevent StatusBar from hiding either remove this entry or enter `false` as the value):

```diff
  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item>
+   <item name="android:windowFullscreen">true</item>
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

If you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.

Read more about `android:windowFullscreen` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowFullscreen).

2. Customize `StatusBar style` option

This option is only available for Android devices running Android 6.0 or greater.
To enforce `light` or `dark` StatusBar style for given system color mode, you have to prepare or update your `res/values-v23/styles.xml` file with the following entry (as of this option being supported since API 23, you have to configure specifically named directory containing separate configuration files):

```diff
  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item>
+   <item name="android:windowLightStatusBar">true|false</item>
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

Available values:

- `true` for having dark-colored icons,
- `false` for having light-colored icons.

If you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night-v23` (for dark color mode), etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.

Read more about `android:windowLightStatusBar` flag in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#windowLightStatusBar).

To read more about Android multi-API-level support see [this official documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources).

3. Customize `StatusBar color` option (a.k.a. `background color` of the StatusBar component)

To achieve custom background color you need to create a new color resource and provide it to the SplashScreen `style` description.

Create new color resource in your `res/values/colors.xml` (if your application supports dark mode, consider adding different color in `res/values-night/colors.xml` file):

```diff
  <resources>
    <!-- Below line is handled by '@expo/configure-splash-screen' command and it's discouraged to modify it manually -->
    <color name="splashscreen_background">#D0D0C0</color>
+   <color name="splashscreen_statusbar_color">#(AA)RRGGBB</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->
  </resources>
```

Update your `res/values/styles.xml` file with the following entry:

```diff
  <!-- Main/SplashScreen activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
    <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item>
+   <item name="android:statusBarColor">@color/splashscreen_statusbar_color</item>
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```

If you have multiple `styles.xml` files located in different directories containing exactly the same `style` entry (e.g. in `res/values-night`, `res/values-night-v23`, etc.), be sure to update these files accordingly.

Read more about `android:statusBarColor` option in [official Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr#statusBarColor).

4. Customize `StatusBar translucent` flag

When the StatusBar is translucent, the app will be able to draw under the StatusBar component area.

To make the StatusBar translucent update your `res/values/strings.xml` file with the following content:

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
 <resources>
   <string name="app_name">sdk42</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent">true</string>
</resources>
```

## ❓ Known issues

### iOS caching

Splash Screens on iOS apps can sometimes encounter a caching issue where the previous image will flash before showing the new, intended image. When this occurs, we recommend you try power cycling your device and uninstalling and re-installing the application. However, the caching sometimes can persist for a day or two so be patient if the aforementioned steps were unable to resolve the issue.

### `NATIVE` mode pushes splash image up a little bit

See [`NATIVE`](#native-resize-mode) mode preview above.

> We are aware of this issue and unfortunately haven't been able to provide a solution as of yet. This is on our immediate roadmap...

## ⬆️ Migrate from old versions

### Migrate from expo-splash-screen < 0.12.0

We try to keep changes backward compatible, the code for `expo-splash-screen` will still work as it used to be. However, if you are going to migrate as new style API, here are the steps:

1. Migrate your project from react-native-unimodules to expo-modules-core
2. Remove expo-splash-screen code from MainActivity

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java
+++ b/android/app/src/main/java/com/helloworld/MainActivity.java
 import com.facebook.react.ReactRootView;
 import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;

-import expo.modules.splashscreen.singletons.SplashScreen;
-import expo.modules.splashscreen.SplashScreenImageResizeMode;
-
 public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {
   @Override
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
     // This is required for expo-splash-screen.
     setTheme(R.style.AppTheme);
     super.onCreate(null);
-    // SplashScreen.show(...) has to be called after super.onCreate(...)
-    // Below line is handled by '@expo/configure-splash-screen' command and it's discouraged to modify it manually
-    SplashScreen.show(this, SplashScreenImageResizeMode.CONTAIN, ReactRootView.class, false);
   }
```

3. Override default `resizeMode` and `statusBarTranslucent` in stings.xml

```diff
--- a/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
+++ b/android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
 <resources>
   <string name="app_name">sdk42</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_resize_mode">contain</string>
+  <string name="expo_splash_screen_status_bar_translucent">false</string>
</resources>
```

## Compatibility

This module requires `expo-cli@3.17.6` or later; make sure your global installation is at least this version before proceeding.

Additionally, this module is only compatible with Expo SDK 37 or later. For bare workflow projects, if the `expo` package is installed, it must be version `37.0.2` or later.

Finally, this module is not compatible with ExpoKit. Make sure you do not have `expokit` listed as a dependency in package.json before adding this module.

## Upgrading

If you're upgrading from `expo-updates@0.1.x`, you can opt into the **no-publish workflow**. In this workflow, release builds of both iOS and Android apps will create and embed a new update at build-time from the JS code currently on disk, rather than embedding a copy of the most recently published update. For instructions and more information, see the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/expo/expo/blob/main/packages/expo-updates/CHANGELOG.md). (For new projects, the no-publish workflow is enabled by default.)

# Installation in managed Expo projects

For [managed](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects, please follow the installation instructions in the [API documentation for the latest stable release](https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/updates/).

# Installation in bare React Native projects

Learn how to install expo-updates in your project in the [Installing expo-updates documentation page](https://docs.expo.dev/bare/installing-updates/).

## Embedded Assets

In certain situations, assets that are `require`d by your JavaScript are embedded into your application binary by Xcode/Android Studio. This allows these assets to load when the packager server running locally on your machine is not available.

Debug builds of Android apps do not, by default, have any assets bundled into the APK; they are always loaded at runtime from the Metro packager.

Debug builds of iOS apps built for the iOS simulator also do not have assets bundled into the app. They are loaded at runtime from Metro. Debug builds of iOS apps built for a real device **do** have assets bundled into the app binary, so they can be loaded from disk if they cannot be loaded from the packager at runtime.

Release builds of both iOS and Android apps include a full embedded update, including manifest, JavaScript bundle, and all imported assets. This is critical to ensure that your app can load for all users immediately upon installation, without needing to talk to a server first.

## Configuration

Some build-time configuration options are available to allow your app to update automatically on launch. On iOS, these properties are set as keys in `Expo.plist` and on Android as `meta-data` tags in `AndroidManifest.xml`, adjacent to the tags added during installation.

On Android, you may also define these properties at runtime by passing a `Map` as the second parameter of `UpdatesController.initialize()`. If provided, the values in this Map will override any values specified in `AndroidManifest.xml`. On iOS, you may set these properties at runtime by calling `[UpdatesController.sharedInstance setConfiguration:]` at any point _before_ calling `start` or `startAndShowLaunchScreen`, and the values in this dictionary will override Expo.plist.

| iOS plist/dictionary key | Android Map key | Android meta-data name         | Default | Required? |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- | --------- |
| `EXUpdatesEnabled`       | `enabled`       | `expo.modules.updates.ENABLED` | `true`  | ❌        |

Whether updates are enabled. Setting this to `false` disables all update functionality, all module methods, and forces the app to load with the manifest and assets bundled into the app binary.

| iOS plist/dictionary key | Android Map key | Android meta-data name                 | Default | Required? |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| `EXUpdatesURL`           | `updateUrl`     | `expo.modules.updates.EXPO_UPDATE_URL` | (none)  | ✅        |

The URL to the remote server where the app should check for updates. A request to this URL should return a valid manifest object for the latest available update and tells expo-updates how to fetch the JS bundle and other assets that comprise the update. (Example: for apps published with `expo publish`, this URL would be `https://exp.host/@username/slug`.)

| iOS plist/dictionary key | Android Map key | Android meta-data name                  | Default | Required?                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EXUpdatesSDKVersion`    | `sdkVersion`    | `expo.modules.updates.EXPO_SDK_VERSION` | (none)  | (exactly one of `sdkVersion` or `runtimeVersion` is required) |

The SDK version string to send under the `Expo-SDK-Version` header in the manifest request. Required for apps hosted on Expo's server.

| iOS plist/dictionary key  | Android Map key  | Android meta-data name                      | Default | Required?                                                     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `EXUpdatesRuntimeVersion` | `runtimeVersion` | `expo.modules.updates.EXPO_RUNTIME_VERSION` | (none)  | (exactly one of `sdkVersion` or `runtimeVersion` is required) |

The Runtime Version string to send under the `Expo-Runtime-Version` header in the manifest request.

| iOS plist/dictionary key  | Android Map key  | Android meta-data name                      | Default   | Required? |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| `EXUpdatesReleaseChannel` | `releaseChannel` | `expo.modules.updates.EXPO_RELEASE_CHANNEL` | `default` | ❌        |

The release channel string to send under the `Expo-Release-Channel` header in the manifest request.

| iOS plist/dictionary key | Android Map key | Android meta-data name                              | Default  | Required? |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- |
| `EXUpdatesCheckOnLaunch` | `checkOnLaunch` | `expo.modules.updates.EXPO_UPDATES_CHECK_ON_LAUNCH` | `ALWAYS` | ❌        |

The condition under which `expo-updates` should automatically check for (and download, if one exists) an update upon app launch. Possible values are `ALWAYS`, `NEVER` (if you want to exclusively control updates via this module's JS API), `WIFI_ONLY` (if you want the app to automatically download updates only if the device is on an unmetered Wi-Fi connection when it launches), or `ERROR_RECOVERY_ONLY` (if you want the app to automatically download updates only if it encounters a fatal error when launching).

Regardless of the value of this setting, as long as updates are enabled, your app can always use the JS API to manually check for and download updates in the background while your app is running.

| iOS plist/dictionary key | Android Map key | Android meta-data name                             | Default | Required? |
| ------------------------ | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| `EXUpdatesLaunchWaitMs`  | `launchWaitMs`  | `expo.modules.updates.EXPO_UPDATES_LAUNCH_WAIT_MS` | `0`     | ❌        |

The number of milliseconds `expo-updates` should delay the app launch and stay on the splash screen while trying to download an update, before falling back to a previously downloaded version. Setting this to `0` will cause the app to always launch with a previously downloaded update and will result in the fastest app launch possible.

| iOS plist/dictionary key          | Android Map key          | Android meta-data name                             | Default | Required? |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| `EXUpdatesCodeSigningCertificate` | `codeSigningCertificate` | `expo.modules.updates.CODE_SIGNING_CERTIFICATE`    | (none)  | ❌        |
| `EXUpdatesCodeSigningMetadata`    | `codeSigningMetadata`    | `expo.modules.updates.CODE_SIGNING_METADATA`       | (none)  | ❌        |
| `EXUpdatesCodeSigningIncludeManifestResponseCertificateChain` | `codeSigningIncludeManifestResponseCertificateChain` | `expo.modules.updates.CODE_SIGNING_INCLUDE_MANIFEST_RESPONSE_CERTIFICATE_CHAIN` | false | ❌        |

If `codeSigningCertificate` is present, `expo-updates` will enforce manifest code signing using the certificate and any metadata associated with it.
- `codeSigningCertificate` must be a valid PEM formatted X.509 certificate with code signing extended key usage.
- `codeSigningMetadata` (optional) must be a JSON object containing:
    - `alg` - Algorithm used to generate manifest signature. Only `rsa-v1_5-sha256` is currently supported.
    - `keyid` - Identifier for the key in `codeSigningCertificate`. Used to instruct signing mechanisms when signing or verifying signatures.
- `codeSigningIncludeManifestResponseCertificateChain` (optional) instructs `expo-updates` to evaluate certificates included in a multipart manifest response (under the `certificate_chain` multipart part) as part of the code signing certificate chain with the embedded `codeSigningCertificate` as the implicitly trusted root certificate of the chain. The leaf certificate in the chain must be valid for code signing.
- `codeSigningAllowUnsignedManifests` (optional) instructs `expo-updates` to treat a missing signature in the response as if code signing weren't enabled rather than as invalid as it normally would.

## Customizing automatic setup

In `expo-updates@0.9.0` and above, we support automatic installation of the module in the iOS AppDelegate.m and Android MainApplication.java classes. If you want to customize the installation, e.g. to enable updates only in some build variants, you can add custom logic in AppDelegate/MainApplication and set the following keys to `false` in order to disable the automatic setup.

| iOS Expo.plist key   | Android meta-data name            | Default | Required? |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------- | --------- |
| `EXUpdatesAutoSetup` | `expo.modules.updates.AUTO_SETUP` | `true`  | ❌        |

# Removing pre-installed expo-updates

Projects created by `expo init` and `expo eject` come with expo-updates pre-installed, because we anticipate most users will want this functionality. However, if you do not intend to use OTA updates, you can disable or uninstall the module.

## Disabling expo-updates

If you disable updates, the module will stay installed in case you ever want to use it in the future, but none of the OTA-updating code paths will ever be executed in your builds. To disable OTA updates, add the `EXUpdatesEnabled` key to Expo.plist with a boolean value of `NO`, and add the following line to AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<meta-data android:name="expo.modules.updates.ENABLED" android:value="false"/>
```

## Uninstalling expo-updates (for expo-updates >= 0.9.0)

Uninstalling the module will entirely remove all expo-updates related code from your codebase. To do so, complete the following steps:

- Remove `expo-updates` from your package.json and reinstall your node modules.
- Delete Expo.plist from your Xcode project and file system.
- Remove all `meta-data` tags with `expo.modules.updates` in the `android:name` field from AndroidManifest.xml.

## Uninstalling expo-updates (for expo-updates < 0.9.0)

Uninstalling the module will entirely remove all expo-updates related code from your codebase. To do so, complete the following steps:

- Remove `expo-updates` from your package.json and reinstall your node modules.
- Remove the line `../node_modules/expo-updates/scripts/create-manifest-ios.sh` from the "Bundle React Native code and images" Build Phase in Xcode.
- Delete Expo.plist from your Xcode project and file system.
- Remove the line `apply from: "../../node_modules/expo-updates/scripts/create-manifest-android.gradle"` from `android/app/build.gradle`.
- Remove all `meta-data` tags with `expo.modules.updates` in the `android:name` field from AndroidManifest.xml.
- Apply the following three diffs:

#### `AppDelegate.h`

Remove`EXUpdatesAppControllerDelegate` as a protocol of your `AppDelegate`.

```diff

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - expo-web-browser@10.2.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# expo-web-browser

Provides access to the system's web browser and supports handling redirects. On iOS, it uses SFSafariViewController or SFAuthenticationSession, depending on the method you call, and on Android it uses ChromeCustomTabs. As of iOS 11, SFSafariViewController no longer shares cookies with Safari, so if you are using WebBrowser for authentication you will want to use WebBrowser.openAuthSessionAsync, and if you just want to open a webpage (such as your app privacy policy), then use WebBrowser.openBrowserAsync.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - fb-watchman@2.0.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# fb-watchman

`fb-watchman` is a filesystem watcher that uses the
[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) file watching service from
Facebook.

Watchman provides file change notification services using very
efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and
filesystem tree querying operations using
[a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).

## Install

You should [install Watchman](
https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this
module.

Then simply:

```
$ npm install fb-watchman
```

## Key Concepts

- Watchman recursively watches directories.
- Each watched directory is called a `root`.
- You must initiate a `watch` on a `root` using the `watch-project` command prior to subscribing to changes
- Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, `watch-project` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your `.watchmanconfig` or source control repository root)
- change notifications are relative to the project root

## How do I use it?

[Read the NodeJS watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/nodejs.html)

      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - flow-parser@0.121.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# The flow-parser package

This package contains the Flow parser in its compiled-to-JavaScript form.

# What is Flow

See [flow.org](https://flow.org/). The code for the Flow parser [lives on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/flow/tree/master/src/parser).

# What is the Flow Parser

The Flow Parser is a JavaScript parser written in OCaml. It produces an AST that conforms to the [ESTree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree) and that mostly matches what [esprima](http://esprima.org/) produces. The Flow Parser can be compiled to native code or can be compiled to JavaScript using [js_of_ocaml](http://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/). This npm package contains the Flow parser compiled to JavaScript.

# Usage

You can use the Flow parser in your browser or in node. To use in node you can just do

```JavaScript
require('flow-parser').parse('1+1', {});
```

To use in the browser, you can add

```HTML
<script src="flow_parser.js"></script>
```

which will make the `flow` object available to use like so:

```JavaScript
flow.parse('1+1', {});
```

## Options

The second argument to `flow.parse` is the options object. Currently supported options:

* `enums` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of Flow enums
* `esproposal_decorators` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of decorators
* `esproposal_class_instance_fields` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of class instance fields
* `esproposal_class_static_fields` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of class static fields
* `esproposal_export_star_as` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of `export * as` syntax
* `esproposal_optional_chaining` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of optional chaining (`?.`)
* `esproposal_nullish_coalescing` (boolean, default `false`) - enable parsing of nullish coalescing (`??`)
* `types` (boolean, default `true`) - enable parsing of Flow types

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - imurmurhash@0.1.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

```
  
## Usage
Get your ip address, compare ip addresses, validate ip addresses, etc.

```js
var ip = require('ip');

ip.address() // my ip address
ip.isEqual('::1', '::0:1'); // true
ip.toBuffer('127.0.0.1') // Buffer([127, 0, 0, 1])
ip.toString(new Buffer([127, 0, 0, 1])) // 127.0.0.1
ip.fromPrefixLen(24) // 255.255.255.0
ip.mask('192.168.1.134', '255.255.255.0') // 192.168.1.0
ip.cidr('192.168.1.134/26') // 192.168.1.128
ip.not('255.255.255.0') // 0.0.0.255
ip.or('192.168.1.134', '0.0.0.255') // 192.168.1.255
ip.isPrivate('127.0.0.1') // true
ip.isV4Format('127.0.0.1'); // true
ip.isV6Format('::ffff:127.0.0.1'); // true

// operate on buffers in-place
var buf = new Buffer(128);
var offset = 64;
ip.toBuffer('127.0.0.1', buf, offset);  // [127, 0, 0, 1] at offset 64
ip.toString(buf, offset, 4);            // '127.0.0.1'

// subnet information
ip.subnet('192.168.1.134', '255.255.255.192')
// { networkAddress: '192.168.1.128',
//   firstAddress: '192.168.1.129',
//   lastAddress: '192.168.1.190',
//   broadcastAddress: '192.168.1.191',
//   subnetMask: '255.255.255.192',
//   subnetMaskLength: 26,
//   numHosts: 62,
//   length: 64,
//   contains: function(addr){...} }
ip.cidrSubnet('192.168.1.134/26')
// Same as previous.

// range checking
ip.cidrSubnet('192.168.1.134/26').contains('192.168.1.190') // true


// ipv4 long conversion
ip.toLong('127.0.0.1'); // 2130706433

This package contains the following license and notice below:

CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
  a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
  or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
  CC0 or use of the Work.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Metro Hermes Compiler

This experimental module provides a high-level API to work with the Hermes bytecode compiler (HBC). HBC is integrated as a WASM binary generated by the emscripten toolchain and checked in as part of this package.

## How to build HBC

A pre-configured emscripten environment can be used through this [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/trzeci/emscripten/). Docker can be installed via its [desktop app](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/). Make sure to increase resource limits (16G RAM, as much CPU as possible).

```
cd path/to/hermes/checkout
docker run -i -t --rm -v `pwd`:`pwd` trzeci/emscripten bash
apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y icu-devtools
cd path/to/hermes/checkout
cmake . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/emsdk_portable/emscripten/sdk/cmake/Modules/Platform/Emscripten.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j emhermesc
```

After the build process finishes the Hermes Bytecode Compiler JavaScript file will be available in the `bin` folder.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - metro-react-native-babel-preset@0.67.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# metro-react-native-babel-preset

Babel presets for [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) applications. React Native itself uses this Babel preset by default when transforming your app's source code.

If you wish to use a custom Babel configuration by writing a `babel.config.js` file in your project's root directory, you must specify all the plugins necessary to transform your code. React Native does not apply its default Babel configuration in this case. So, to make your life easier, you can use this preset to get the default configuration and then specify more plugins that run before it.

## Usage

As mentioned above, you only need to use this preset if you are writing a custom `babel.config.js` file.

### Installation

Install `metro-react-native-babel-preset` in your app:

with `npm`:

```sh
npm i metro-react-native-babel-preset --save-dev
```

or with `yarn`:

```sh
yarn add -D metro-react-native-babel-preset
```

### Configuring Babel

Then, create a file called `babel.config.js` in your project's root directory. The existence of this `babel.config.js` file will tell React Native to use your custom Babel configuration instead of its own. Then load this preset:

```
{
  "presets": ["module:metro-react-native-babel-preset"]
}
```

You can further customize your Babel configuration by specifying plugins and other options. See [Babel's `babel.config.js` documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/config-files/) to learn more.

## Help and Support

If you get stuck configuring Babel, please ask a question on Stack Overflow or find a consultant for help. If you discover a bug, please open up an issue.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

You may use the Forge project under the terms of either the BSD License or the
GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2.

The BSD License is recommended for most projects. It is simple and easy to
understand and it places almost no restrictions on what you can do with the
Forge project.

If the GPL suits your project better you are also free to use Forge under
that license.

You don't have to do anything special to choose one license or the other and
you don't have to notify anyone which license you are using. You are free to
use this project in commercial projects as long as the copyright header is
left intact.

If you are a commercial entity and use this set of libraries in your
commercial software then reasonable payment to Digital Bazaar, if you can
afford it, is not required but is expected and would be appreciated. If this
library saves you time, then it's saving you money. The cost of developing
the Forge software was on the order of several hundred hours and tens of
thousands of dollars. We are attempting to strike a balance between helping
the development community while not being taken advantage of by lucrative
commercial entities for our efforts.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
           Version 2, June 1991

 Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

          Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

          NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

Paths.js
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andreaferretti/paths-js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andreaferretti/paths-js)

Paths.js is a library to generate [SVG paths](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html), allowing you to create your own charts using a functional and testable API. It provides the primitives to create various shapes and charts starting from raw data, but it does not prescribe how you render these charts. This means you can use Paths.js to build components for your favorite frontend framework, and works even server-side on [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/).

Paths.js offers three APIs, of increasing abstraction. The lowest level is a chainable API to generate an arbitrary SVG path. On top of this, paths for simple geometric shapes such as polygons or circle sectors are defined. At the highest level, there is an API to generate some simple graphs (pie, line chart, radar...) for a collection of data, assembling the simple shapes.

Latest version is `0.4.6` - see [this](#migration-to-04) for the necessary changes from `0.3.5`.

Demos
-----

Of course, when judging a chart library, the first request is to have a look at results. But Paths.js is different: it provides the geometry, and you draw the charts.

That said, we have two demos. The [first one](http://andreaferretti.github.io/paths-js-react-demo) is written using React ([source here](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js-react-demo)).

The [old demo](http://andreaferretti.github.io/paths-js-demo/) is written using Ractive ([source here](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js-demo)).

Philosophy
----------

Drawing beautiful charts is a craft, and often one needs to add custom interactions, styling or animations. There are some beautiful chart libraries out there, such as [Flotcharts](http://www.flotcharts.org/) or [Dimple](http://dimplejs.org/), and if those are enough for your needs, they can be a pleasure to use.

In many cases, though, what I really wanted was a library to take care of the generation of the chart, while still leaving me the possibility to render the actual thing. Paths.js does exactly this. It eventually generates [SVG paths](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html) with a high level API. These paths can be then used together with a template engine such as [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/) or [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) to display SVG graphics in the browser. If instead of a static template engine, you use a data binding library, such as [Facebook React](http://facebook.github.io/react/), [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/) or [Angular](http://angularjs.org/), you get animated graphics for free.

In designing Paths.js, I have tried to follow a few principles:

* paths should be immutable
* all exposed methods should be pure
* from this follows that it is trivial to test components
* and that they work on Node.js as well
* it should be easy to integrate Paths.js into various frameworks


Documentation
-------------

A detailed documentation is available on the [wiki](). Here are links to the main entry points.

Paths.js offers three APIs, of increasing abstraction. The lowest level is a chainable API to generate an arbitrary SVG path. On top of this, paths for simple geometric shapes such as polygons or circle sectors are defined. At the highest level, there is an API to generate some simple graphs (pie, line chart, radar...) for a collection of data, assembling the simple shapes.

- [Installation and usage](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js/wiki)
- [Low level API](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js/wiki/Low%20level%20API)
- [Mid level API (shapes)](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js/wiki/Mid-level-API)
- [High level API (graphs)](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js/wiki/High-level-API)
- [Miscellaneous](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-js/wiki/Miscellaneous)

Those users who prefer explicit typed interfaces can [browse the API](http://andreaferretti.github.io/paths-scala-js) of the Scala.js bindings.

Resources
---------

These resources give a more detailed exposition of the philosophy behind Paths.js:

* [Reactive SVG charts with Ractive.js and Paths.js](http://mlarocca.github.io/01-22-2014/pathsjs_ractive.html) by Marcello La Rocca
* [My talk at MilanoJS user group](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-talk-slides), together with the [examples](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-talk-examples)
* [Reactive SVG charts with Ractive.js](http://mlarocca.github.io/graphicalweb2014/)
* [Visualization is for Sharing: Using React for Portable Data Visualization](http://viget.com/extend/visualization-is-for-sharing-using-react-for-portable-data-visualization) by Nate Hunzaker
* [How to Create Performant, Template-based Charts with Paths.js](http://www.sitepoint.com/create-performant-template-based-charts-paths-js/)

Browser support
---------------

Paths.js works in any environment that supports a modern version of Javascript, namely ES5. This includes any version of Node.js and all recent browsers. If you need support for older browsers, you can include an [ES5 polyfill](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim/).

On the other hand, not every browser will be able to display the SVG graphics that you will generate. Usually, recent desktop browsers are ok, but mobile browser are slow in adopting the SVG specification. You can refer to [caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#search=svg) for more detailed information.

Migration to 0.4
----------------

Version 0.4 was rewritten in ES6 instead of CoffeeScript for future-proofing. The currently published version is `0.4.0`.

A few API changes were introduced, namely all keys are now camel cased.

In particular:

* in the low-level verbose API, `large_arc_flag` has been renamed to `largeArcFlag`, and `sweep_flag` to `sweepFlag`
* the rectangle width in the Sankey diagram, is now called `rectWidth` instead of `rect_width`

Also, the default for the `gutter` parameter is now `10` everywhere (that is, also in the `Bar` and `Waterfall` charts).

Everything else should be the same, so if you find any regression, please open a issue.

Using Paths.js with the Canvas API
----------------------------------

Paths.js does not directly support the [canvas element](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element), essentially because there is no need to do so. The [canvg](https://github.com/gabelerner/canvg) project allows to draw SVG paths on a `<canvas>` element, and it seems that canvas [will be able](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2012Mar/0269.html) to support SVG paths natively. Of course, canvas-based solutions limit the possibilities offered by data binding libraries for interaction, but they could be used as a fallback on less recent browsers.

Using Paths.js with Scala.js
----------------------------

It is possible to use Paths.js with [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) - [this library](https://github.com/andreaferretti/paths-scala-js) defines the bindings.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - react-devtools-core@4.25.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# `react-devtools-core`

This package provides low-level APIs to support renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native). If you're looking for the standalone React DevTools UI, **we suggest using [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) instead of using this package directly**.

This package provides two entrypoints: labeled "backend" and "standalone" (frontend). Both APIs are described below.

# Backend API

Backend APIs are embedded in _development_ builds of renderers like [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) in order to connect to the React DevTools UI.

### Example

If you are building a non-browser-based React renderer, you can use the backend API like so:

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  const { connectToDevTools } = require("react-devtools-core");

  // Must be called before packages like react or react-native are imported
  connectToDevTools({
    ...config
  });
}
```

> **NOTE** that this API (`connectToDevTools`) must be (1) run in the same context as React and (2) must be called before React packages are imported (e.g. `react`, `react-dom`, `react-native`).

### `connectToDevTools` options
| Prop | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `host` | `"localhost"` | Socket connection to frontend should use this host. |
| `isAppActive` |  | (Optional) function that returns true/false, telling DevTools when it's ready to connect to React. |
| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to frontend should use this port. |
| `resolveRNStyle` |  | (Optional) function that accepts a key (number) and returns a style (object); used by React Native. |
| `retryConnectionDelay` | `200` | Delay (ms) to wait between retrying a failed Websocket connection |
| `useHttps` | `false` | Socket connection to frontend should use secure protocol (wss). |
| `websocket` |  | Custom `WebSocket` connection to frontend; overrides `host` and `port` settings. |

# Frontend API

Frontend APIs can be used to render the DevTools UI into a DOM node. One example of this is [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools) which wraps DevTools in an Electron app.

### Example
```js
import DevtoolsUI from "react-devtools-core/standalone";

// See the full list of API methods in documentation below.
const { setContentDOMNode, startServer } = DevtoolsUI;

// Render DevTools UI into a DOM element.
setContentDOMNode(document.getElementById("container"));

// Start socket server used to communicate between backend and frontend.
startServer(
  // Port defaults to 8097
  1234,

  // Host defaults to "localhost"
  "example.devserver.com",

  // Optional config for secure socket (WSS).
  {
    key: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('test/fixtures/keys/agent2-cert.pem')
  }
);
```

### Exported methods
The `default` export is an object defining the methods described below.

These methods support chaining for convenience. For example:
```js
const DevtoolsUI = require("react-devtools-core/standalone");
DevtoolsUI.setContentDOMNode(element).startServer();
```

#### `connectToSocket(socket: WebSocket)`
> This is an advanced config function that is typically not used.

Custom `WebSocket` connection to use for communication between DevTools frontend and backend. Calling this method automatically initializes the DevTools UI (similar to calling `startServer()`).

#### `openProfiler()`
Automatically select the "Profiler" tab in the DevTools UI.

#### `setContentDOMNode(element: HTMLElement)`
Set the DOM element DevTools UI should be rendered into on initialization.

#### `setDisconnectedCallback(callback: Function)`
_Optional_ callback to be notified when DevTools `WebSocket` closes (or errors).

#### `setProjectRoots(roots: Array<string>)`
_Optional_ set of root directores for source files. These roots can be used to open an inspected component's source code using an IDE.

#### `setStatusListener(callback: Function)`
_Optional_ callback to be notified of socket server events (e.g. initialized, errored, connected).

This callback receives two parameters:
```js
function onStatus(
  message: string,
  status: 'server-connected' | 'devtools-connected' | 'error'
): void {
  // ...
}
```

#### `startServer(port?: number, host?: string, httpsOptions?: Object, loggerOptions?: Object)`
Start a socket server (used to communicate between backend and frontend) and renders the DevTools UI.

This method accepts the following parameters:
| Name | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `port` | `8097` | Socket connection to backend should use this port. |
| `host` | `"localhost"` | Socket connection to backend should use this host. |
| `httpsOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining `key` and `cert` strings. |
| `loggerOptions` | | _Optional_ object defining a `surface` string (to be included with DevTools logging events). |

# Development

Watch for changes made to the backend entry point and rebuild:
```sh
yarn start:backend
```

Watch for changes made to the standalone UI entry point and rebuild:
```sh
yarn start:standalone
```

Run the standalone UI using `yarn start` in the [`react-devtools`](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/main/packages/react-devtools).

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - readline@1.3.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## _readline_
> Read a file line by line.

## Install

## Important. In node 10 there is a core module named readline. Please use linebyline instead, it is the same module just renamed:
[Npm linebyline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/linebyline)

```sh
npm install linebyline
```

## Test
```sh
npm install .
npm test

```


## What's this?

Simple streaming readline module for NodeJS. Reads a file and buffers new lines emitting a _line_ event for each line.

## Usage
### Simple
```js
  var readline = require('linebyline'),
      rl = readline('./somefile.txt');
  rl.on('line', function(line, lineCount, byteCount) {
    // do something with the line of text
  })
  .on('error', function(e) {
    // something went wrong
  });
```

### ASCII file decoding
As the underlying `fs.createReadStream` doesn't care about the specific ASCII encoding of the file, an alternative way to decode the file is by telling the `readline` library to retain buffer and then decoding it using a converter (e.g. [`iconv-lite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/iconv-lite)).
```js
  var readline = require('linebyline'),
      rl = readline('./file-in-win1251.txt', {
    retainBuffer: true //tell readline to retain buffer 
  });
  rl.on("line", function (data,linecount){
    var line = iconv.decode(data, 'win1251');
    // do something with the line of converted text
  });
```
##API
## readLine(readingObject[, options])
### Params:

* `readingObject` - file path or stream object
* `options` can include:
  * `maxLineLength` - override the default 4K buffer size (lines longer than this will not be read)
  * `retainBuffer` - avoid converting to String prior to emitting 'line' event; will pass raw buffer with encoded data to the callback

### Return:

* **EventEmitter**

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - safe-json-stringify@1.2.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Safe JSON Stringify
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/debitoor/safe-json-stringify.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/debitoor/safe-json-stringify)
[![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/safe-json-stringify.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/safe-json-stringify)

A wrapper for `JSON.stringify` that handles circular references and prevents defined getters from throwing errors.

Circular references are handled by returning `[Circular]` when a circular reference is spotted.

Defined getters that throw errors are handled by returning `[Throws]`.

Usage
-----
Install it using NPM

```sh
npm install safe-json-stringify
```

And require it into your Node project.

```js
const safeJsonStringify = require('safe-json-stringify');
const data = {foo: 'bar'}

console.log(safeJsonStringify(data));
```

All the parameters of `JSON.stringify` are accepted, try e.g. the following for a nicely formatted output:

```js
console.log(safeJsonStringify(data, null, 2));
```

An `ensureProperties` function is exposed too, which returns a safe object without the stringify step. Usage: `safeJsonStringify.ensureProperties(data);`.


Why?
----
The `stringify` function on the JavaScript JSON object will take any data and return a string representation of said data. If this data contains an object literal it will attempt to return the values of any enumerable property set on this object. This can be dangerous because JavaScript supports a couple of ways to define property getters on objects.

The old, non-standard, and now deprecated `Object.prototype.__defineGetter__()` will define a named property which value is the return of a given function.

```js
// Never ever do this in your code. Please.
var obj = {};
obj.__defineGetter__('foo', function() { return 'bar'; });

JSON.stringify(obj); // {"foo":"bar"}
```

This is kinda bad because we could make that function throw an error.

```js
// Never ever do this in your code. Please.
var obj = {};
obj.__defineGetter__('foo', function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); });

JSON.stringify(obj); // error thrown
```

This property is created as an enumerable on the object, so the object from the previous example would make any function that iterates choke and throw an error. This is bad because one would never expect a simple property get to throw an error and bring down a system.

`JSON.stringify` will blindly trust any object property, and will throw an error if it hits a defined property that throws an error. This could potentially take down your program.

The slightly better `Object.defineProperty()` does the same thing, but has the common courtesy to not define the getter as enumerable--that is per default. The following example would bring us in the same situation as with `__defineGetter__`.

```js
// Never ever do this in your code. Please.
var obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {
    get: function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); },
        enumerable: true // enumerable is false by default
});

JSON.stringify(obj); // error thrown
```

So, we can not trust any of them. One could argue that they should never be used, and we can, and should, apply that principle to our own software, but we cannot trust code from third-party modules. If data from third-party modules are to be stringified by JSON we should take these situations into considerations. This module attempt to do that by spotting defined getters and return "[Throws]" if said getter throws an error.

```js
var safeJsonStringify = require('safe-json-stringify');
// Never ever do this in your code. Please.
var obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'foo', {
    get: function() { throw new Error('ouch!'); },
        enumerable: true
});

safeJsonStringify(obj); // '{"foo":"[Throws]"}'
```

And it attempts to handle circular references too. It returns "[Circular]" if it spots one.

 - stream-buffers@2.2.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Node Stream Buffers

[![Build Status][badge-travis-img]][badge-travis-url]
[![Code Climate][badge-climate-img]][badge-climate-url]
[![Code Coverage][badge-coverage-img]][badge-coverage-url]

Simple Readable and Writable Streams that use a [Buffer][node-buffer-docs] to store received data, or for data to send out. Useful for test code, debugging, and a wide range of other utilities.

## Installation

[![NPM][badge-npm-img]][badge-npm-url]

## Usage

To use the stream buffers in your module, simply import it and away you go.

```js
var streamBuffers = require("stream-buffers");
```

### Writable StreamBuffer

Writable Stream Buffers implement the standardized writable stream interface. All write()'s to this object will accumulate in an internal Buffer. If the Buffer overflows it will be resized larger automatically. The initial size of the Buffer and the amount in which it grows can be configured in the constructor.

```js
var myWritableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.WritableStreamBuffer({
	initialSize: (100 * 1024),		// start as 100 kilobytes.
	incrementAmount: (10 * 1024)	// grow by 10 kilobytes each time buffer overflows.
});
```

The default initial size and increment amount are stored in the following constants:

```js
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_INITIAL_SIZE 		// (8 * 1024)
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_INCREMENT_AMOUNT	// (8 * 1024)
```

Writing is standard Stream stuff:

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.write(myBuffer);
// - or -
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("\u00bd + \u00bc = \u00be", "utf8");
```

You can query the size of the data being held in the Buffer, and also how big the Buffer's max capacity currently is: 

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("ASDF");
streamBuffers.size();			// 4.
streamBuffers.maxSize();		// Whatever was configured as initial size. In our example: (100 * 1024).
```

Retrieving the contents of the Buffer is simple:

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();					// Gets all held data as a Buffer.
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString("utf8");		// Gets all held data as a utf8 string.
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents(5);					// Gets first 5 bytes as a Buffer.
myWritableStreamBuffer.getContentsAsString("utf8", 5);	// Gets first 5 bytes as a utf8 string.
```

Care should be taken when getting encoded strings from WritableStream, as it doesn't really care about the contents (multi-byte characters will not be respected).
 
Destroying or ending the WritableStream will not delete the contents of Buffer, but will disallow any further writes:

```js
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("ASDF");
myWritableStreamBuffer.destroy();

myWritableStreamBuffer.getContents();		// Returns ASDF in Buffer.
myWritableStreamBuffer.write("Yeah?");		// No effect.
```	

### Readable StreamBuffer

Readable Stream Buffers can have data inserted in them, which will then be pumped out via standard readable stream data events. The data to be sent out is held in a Buffer, which can grow in much the same way as a WritableStream Buffer does, if data is being put in Buffer faster than it's being pumped out. 

The frequency in which chunks are pumped out, and the size of the chunks themselves can be configured in the constructor. The initial size and increment amount of internal Buffer can be configured too.

```js
var myReadableStreamBuffer = new streamBuffers.ReadableStreamBuffer({
	frequency: 10,		// in milliseconds.
	chunkSize: 2048		// in bytes.
});
```

Default frequency and chunk size:

```js
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_CHUNK_SIZE 		// (1024)
streamBuffers.DEFAULT_FREQUENCY			// (1)
```

Putting data in Buffer to be pumped out is easy:

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.put(aBuffer);
myReadableStreamBuffer.put("A String", "utf8");
```

Chunks are pumped out via standard readable stream spec: 

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.on("data", function(data) {
	// Yup.
	assert.isTrue(data instanceof Buffer);
});
```

Chunks are pumped out by the interval that you specified in frequency. Setting the frequency to 0 will immediately stream the data (also in chunks), even if the stream has not been piped to a destination. This is useful for unit testing. 

setEncoding() for streams is respected too:

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.setEncoding("utf8");
myReadableStreamBuffer.on("data", function(data) {
	assert.isTrue(data instanceof String);
});
```

Pause and resume are also implemented. pause()'ing stream will allow buffer to continue accumulating, but will not pump any of that data out until it is resume()'d again. 

Destroying the stream will immediately purge the buffer, unless destroySoon() is called, in which case the rest of the buffer will be written out. Either way, any further attempts to put data in the Buffer will be silently ignored. 

```js
myReadableStreamBuffer.destroySoon();
myReadableStreamBuffer.put("A String!");
myReadableStreamBuffer.size();			// will be 0.
```

## Disclaimer

Not supposed to be a speed demon, it's more for tests/debugging or weird edge cases. It works with an internal buffer that it copies contents to/from/around.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - structured-headers@0.4.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

Structured Headers parser for Javascript
========================================

This library is a parser and serializer for the [Structured Headers][1]
specification, a.k.a. "Structured Field Values for HTTP" (RFC8941).

This specification defines a standard serialization for complex HTTP header
values, including lists (arrays), dictionaries (maps) and also numbers,
booleans, and binary data.

The library is written in Typescript, and the examples in this document are
too, but plain Javascript is also fully supported.

Compatibility
-------------

This package has 2725 unittests, the vast majority are supplied from the
official [HTTP WG test suite][2].

However, there are 2 differences in the serializer:

1. Javascript can't differentiate between `1.0` and `1`. As a result we're
   skipping the tests that require a serialiation output of `1.0`.
2. Javascript rounds slightly different from the spec. The tests suggest that
   `0.0025` should round to the nearest event number (`0.002`), but Javascript
   rounds to `0.003`.

No fix is planned for #1, because there's no reasonably way to fix this
without wrapping every number in a custom class, and this will negatively
impact the developer experience. We do intend to fix #2 in the future with a
custom rounding algorithm.

This library emits and expects the _exact_ data structures as they are
suggested by the RFC. The result of this is that the returned types can be
a bit complex.

In the future we intend to loosen the required types for the serializer, and
add new helper functions that give you simpler structures _if_ you don't need
certain features for a header (such as `Parameters`).

Let us know what you would like to see here!

Installation
------------

Using npm:

```
npm install structured-headers
```

API
---

### Parsing an item

The following are examples of `item` headers:

Parsed as string

```
# Parsed as string
Header: "foo"

# A simple string, called a 'Token' in the spec
Header: foo

# Parsed as number
Header: 5
Header: -10
Header: 5.01415

# Parsed into boolean
Header: ?1
Header: ?0

# Binaries are base64 encoded
Header: :RE0gbWUgZm9yIGEgZnJlZSBjb29raWU=:

# Items can have parameters
Header: "Hello world"; a="5"
```


To parse these header values, use the `parseItem`:

```typescript
import { parseItem } from 'structured-headers';

console.log(
  parseItem(header)
);
```

parseItem returns a tuple (array with 2 items), the first item is the value,
the second is a `Map` object with parameters.

The type is roughly:

```typescript

// The raw value
type BareItem = number | string | Token | ByteSequence | boolean;

// The return type of parseItem
type Item = [
  BareItem,
  Map<string, BareItem>
];
```

### Parsing a list

A list is an array of items. Some examples:

```
# A simple list
Header: 5, "foo", bar, ?1

# Each element can have parameters
Header: sometoken; param1; param2=hi, 42

# A list can also contain lists itself. These are called 'inner lists' and
# use parenthesis
Header: sometoken, (innerlistitem1 innerlistitem2), (anotherlist)
```


To parse these:

```typescript
import { parseList } from 'structured-headers';

console.log(
  parseList(header)
);
```

`parseList` returns an array with each member. The return type is:

```typescript
type InnerList = [Item[], Parameters];
type List = (InnerList|Item)[];
```

### Parsing a dictionary

A dictionary is a key->value object. Examples:

```
# A simple dictionary
Header: fn="evert", ln="pot", coffee=?1

# Each item may have parameters too
Header: foo=123; q=1, bar=123, q=0.5

# A dictionary value may be an inner list again
Header: foo=(1 2 3)
```

To parse dictionaries:

```typescript
import { parseDictionary } from 'structured-headers';

console.log(
  parseDictionary(header)
);
```

The return type for `parseDictionary` is a `Map`.

```typescript
type Dictionary = Map<string, Item|InnerList>;
```


### Serializing

The serialiser functions work the exact same way, but in opposite direction.
They all return strings.

Currently the serializes expect the *exact type* that the parsers return, but
the intention is to loosen the types for serialization, so it's a bit more
ergnomic to call. Want this? Let me know by opening an issue.


```javascript
import {
  serializeDictionary,
  serializeList,
  serializeItem
} from 'structured-headers';


// Returns "foo", "bar"
serializeList([
  ['foo', new Map()],
  ['bar', new Map()],
]);

// Returns a=1, b=?0
sh.serializeDictionary(new Map([
  ['a', [1, new Map()]],
  ['b', [false, new Map()]],
]));

// Returns 42
serializeItem([42, new Map()]);

// Returns 5.5
serializeItem([5.5, new Map()]);

// Returns "hello world"
serializeItem(["hello world", new Map()]);

// Returns ?1
serializeItem([true, new Map()]);

// Returns a base-64 representation like: *aGVsbG8=*
serializeItem([new ByteSequence('aGVsbG8='), new Map()]);
```

Browser support
---------------

There is a minified version of this library in the `browser/` directory. This minified
file will expose a global variable called 'structuredHeader' which contains the rest
of the api.

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

TypeORM is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)
that can run in NodeJS, Browser, Cordova, PhoneGap, Ionic, React Native, NativeScript, Expo, and Electron platforms
and can be used with TypeScript and JavaScript (ES5, ES6, ES7, ES8).
Its goal is to always support the latest JavaScript features and provide additional features
that help you to develop any kind of application that uses databases - from
small applications with a few tables to large scale enterprise applications
with multiple databases.

TypeORM supports both [Active Record](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) and [Data Mapper](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) patterns,
unlike all other JavaScript ORMs currently in existence,
which means you can write high quality, loosely coupled, scalable,
maintainable applications the most productive way.

TypeORM is highly influenced by other ORMs, such as [Hibernate](http://hibernate.org/orm/),
[Doctrine](http://www.doctrine-project.org/) and [Entity Framework](https://www.asp.net/entity-framework).

## Features

-   Supports both [DataMapper](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-data-mapper-pattern) and [ActiveRecord](./docs/active-record-data-mapper.md#what-is-the-active-record-pattern) (your choice).
-   Entities and columns.
-   Database-specific column types.
-   Entity manager.
-   Repositories and custom repositories.
-   Clean object relational model.
-   Associations (relations).
-   Eager and lazy relations.
-   Uni-directional, bi-directional and self-referenced relations.
-   Supports multiple inheritance patterns.
-   Cascades.
-   Indices.
-   Transactions.
-   Migrations and automatic migrations generation.
-   Connection pooling.
-   Replication.
-   Using multiple database instances.
-   Working with multiple databases types.
-   Cross-database and cross-schema queries.
-   Elegant-syntax, flexible and powerful QueryBuilder.
-   Left and inner joins.
-   Proper pagination for queries using joins.
-   Query caching.
-   Streaming raw results.
-   Logging.
-   Listeners and subscribers (hooks).
-   Supports closure table pattern.
-   Schema declaration in models or separate configuration files.
-   Connection configuration in json / xml / yml / env formats.
-   Supports MySQL / MariaDB / Postgres / CockroachDB / SQLite / Microsoft SQL Server / Oracle / SAP Hana / sql.js.
-   Supports MongoDB NoSQL database.
-   Works in NodeJS / Browser / Ionic / Cordova / React Native / NativeScript / Expo / Electron platforms.
-   TypeScript and JavaScript support.
-   ESM and CommonJS support.
-   Produced code is performant, flexible, clean and maintainable.
-   Follows all possible best practices.
-   CLI.

And more...

With TypeORM your models look like this:

```javascript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class User {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    firstName: string

    @Column()
    lastName: string

    @Column()
    age: number
}
```

And your domain logic looks like this:

```javascript
const userRepository = MyDataSource.getRepository(User)

const user = new User()
user.firstName = "Timber"
user.lastName = "Saw"
user.age = 25
await userRepository.save(user)

const allUsers = await userRepository.find()
const firstUser = await userRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
}) // find by id
const timber = await userRepository.findOneBy({
    firstName: "Timber",
    lastName: "Saw",
}) // find by firstName and lastName

await userRepository.remove(timber)
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to use the `ActiveRecord` implementation, you can use it as well:

```javascript
import { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column, BaseEntity } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class User extends BaseEntity {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    firstName: string

    @Column()
    lastName: string

    @Column()
    age: number
}
```

And your domain logic will look this way:

```javascript
const user = new User()
user.firstName = "Timber"
user.lastName = "Saw"
user.age = 25
await user.save()

const allUsers = await User.find()
const firstUser = await User.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
const timber = await User.findOneBy({
    firstName: "Timber",
    lastName: "Saw"
})

await timber.remove()
```

## Installation

1. Install the npm package:

    `npm install typeorm --save`

2. You need to install `reflect-metadata` shim:

    `npm install reflect-metadata --save`

    and import it somewhere in the global place of your app (for example in `app.ts`):

    `import "reflect-metadata"`

3. You may need to install node typings:

    `npm install @types/node --save-dev`

4. Install a database driver:

    - for **MySQL** or **MariaDB**

        `npm install mysql --save` (you can install `mysql2` instead as well)

    - for **PostgreSQL** or **CockroachDB**

        `npm install pg --save`

    - for **SQLite**

        `npm install sqlite3 --save`

    - for **Microsoft SQL Server**

        `npm install mssql --save`

    - for **sql.js**

        `npm install sql.js --save`

    - for **Oracle**

        `npm install oracledb --save`

        To make the Oracle driver work, you need to follow the installation instructions from
        [their](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb) site.

    - for **SAP Hana**

        ```
        npm install @sap/hana-client
        npm install hdb-pool
        ```

        _SAP Hana support made possible by the sponsorship of [Neptune Software](https://www.neptune-software.com/)._

    - for **Google Cloud Spanner**

        ```
        npm install @google-cloud/spanner --save
        ```

        Provide authentication credentials to your application code
        by setting the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`:

        ```shell
        # Linux/macOS
        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="KEY_PATH"

        # Windows
        set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=KEY_PATH

        # Replace KEY_PATH with the path of the JSON file that contains your service account key.
        ```

        To use Spanner with the emulator you should set `SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST` environment variable:

        ```shell
        # Linux/macOS
        export SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010

        # Windows
        set SPANNER_EMULATOR_HOST=localhost:9010
        ```

    - for **MongoDB** (experimental)

        `npm install mongodb@^3.6.0 --save`

    - for **NativeScript**, **react-native** and **Cordova**

        Check [documentation of supported platforms](./docs/supported-platforms.md)

    Install only _one_ of them, depending on which database you use.

##### TypeScript configuration

Also, make sure you are using TypeScript version **4.5** or higher,
and you have enabled the following settings in `tsconfig.json`:

```json
"emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
"experimentalDecorators": true,
```

You may also need to enable `es6` in the `lib` section of compiler options, or install `es6-shim` from `@types`.

## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with TypeORM is to use its CLI commands to generate a starter project.
Quick start works only if you are using TypeORM in a NodeJS application.
If you are using other platforms, proceed to the [step-by-step guide](#step-by-step-guide).

To create a new project using CLI, run the following command:

```shell
npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres
```

Where `name` is the name of your project and `database` is the database you'll use.
Database can be one of the following values: `mysql`, `mariadb`, `postgres`, `cockroachdb`, `sqlite`, `mssql`, `sap`, `spanner`, `oracle`, `mongodb`,
`cordova`, `react-native`, `expo`, `nativescript`.

This command will generate a new project in the `MyProject` directory with the following files:

```
MyProject
├── src                   // place of your TypeScript code
│   ├── entity            // place where your entities (database models) are stored
│   │   └── User.ts       // sample entity
│   ├── migration         // place where your migrations are stored
│   ├── data-source.ts    // data source and all connection configuration
│   └── index.ts          // start point of your application
├── .gitignore            // standard gitignore file
├── package.json          // node module dependencies
├── README.md             // simple readme file
└── tsconfig.json         // TypeScript compiler options
```

> You can also run `typeorm init` on an existing node project, but be careful - it may override some files you already have.

The next step is to install new project dependencies:

```shell
cd MyProject
npm install
```

After you have all dependencies installed, edit the `data-source.ts` file and put your own database connection configuration options in there:

```ts
export const AppDataSource = new DataSource({
    type: "postgres",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    username: "test",
    password: "test",
    database: "test",
    synchronize: true,
    logging: true,
    entities: [Post, Category],
    subscribers: [],
    migrations: [],
})
```

Particularly, most of the time you'll only need to configure
`host`, `username`, `password`, `database` and maybe `port` options.

Once you finish with configuration and all node modules are installed, you can run your application:

```shell
npm start
```

That's it, your application should successfully run and insert a new user into the database.
You can continue to work with this project and integrate other modules you need and start
creating more entities.

> You can generate an ESM project by running
> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres --module esm` command.

> You can generate an even more advanced project with express installed by running
> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database mysql --express` command.

> You can generate a docker-compose file by running
> `npx typeorm init --name MyProject --database postgres --docker` command.

## Step-by-Step Guide

What are you expecting from ORM?
First of all, you are expecting it will create database tables for you
and find / insert / update / delete your data without the pain of
having to write lots of hardly maintainable SQL queries.
This guide will show you how to set up TypeORM from scratch and make it do what you are expecting from an ORM.

### Create a model

Working with a database starts from creating tables.
How do you tell TypeORM to create a database table?
The answer is - through the models.
Your models in your app are your database tables.

For example, you have a `Photo` model:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    id: number
    name: string
    description: string
    filename: string
    views: number
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

And you want to store photos in your database.
To store things in the database, first, you need a database table,
and database tables are created from your models.
Not all models, but only those you define as _entities_.

### Create an entity

_Entity_ is your model decorated by an `@Entity` decorator.
A database table will be created for such models.
You work with entities everywhere in TypeORM.
You can load/insert/update/remove and perform other operations with them.

Let's make our `Photo` model an entity:

```javascript
import { Entity } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    id: number
    name: string
    description: string
    filename: string
    views: number
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

Now, a database table will be created for the `Photo` entity and we'll be able to work with it anywhere in our app.
We have created a database table, however, what table can exist without columns?
Let's create few columns in our database table.

### Adding table columns

To add database columns, you simply need to decorate an entity's properties you want to make into a column
with a `@Column` decorator.

```javascript
import { Entity, Column } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @Column()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @Column()
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column()
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

Now `id`, `name`, `description`, `filename`, `views` and `isPublished` columns will be added to the `photo` table.
Column types in the database are inferred from the property types you used, e.g.
`number` will be converted into `integer`, `string` into `varchar`, `boolean` into `bool`, etc.
But you can use any column type your database supports by explicitly specifying a column type into the `@Column` decorator.

We generated a database table with columns, but there is one thing left.
Each database table must have a column with a primary key.

### Creating a primary column

Each entity **must** have at least one primary key column.
This is a requirement and you can't avoid it.
To make a column a primary key, you need to use the `@PrimaryColumn` decorator.

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryColumn } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @PrimaryColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @Column()
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column()
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

### Creating an auto-generated column

Now, let's say you want your id column to be auto-generated (this is known as auto-increment / sequence / serial / generated identity column).
To do that, you need to change the `@PrimaryColumn` decorator to a `@PrimaryGeneratedColumn` decorator:

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @Column()
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column()
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

### Column data types

Next, let's fix our data types. By default, the string is mapped to a varchar(255)-like type (depending on the database type).
The number is mapped to an integer-like type (depending on the database type).
We don't want all our columns to be limited varchars or integers.
Let's setup correct data types:

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn } from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column({
        length: 100,
    })
    name: string

    @Column("text")
    description: string

    @Column()
    filename: string

    @Column("double")
    views: number

    @Column()
    isPublished: boolean
}
```

Column types are database-specific.
You can set any column type your database supports.
More information on supported column types can be found [here](./docs/entities.md#column-types).

### Creating a new `DataSource`

Now, when our entity is created, let's create `index.ts` file and set up our `DataSource` there:

```javascript
import "reflect-metadata"
import { DataSource } from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"

const AppDataSource = new DataSource({
    type: "postgres",
    host: "localhost",
    port: 5432,
    username: "root",
    password: "admin",
    database: "test",
    entities: [Photo],
    synchronize: true,
    logging: false,
})

// to initialize initial connection with the database, register all entities
// and "synchronize" database schema, call "initialize()" method of a newly created database
// once in your application bootstrap
AppDataSource.initialize()
    .then(() => {
        // here you can start to work with your database
    })
    .catch((error) => console.log(error))
```

We are using Postgres in this example, but you can use any other supported database.
To use another database, simply change the `type` in the options to the database type you are using:
`mysql`, `mariadb`, `postgres`, `cockroachdb`, `sqlite`, `mssql`, `oracle`, `sap`, `spanner`, `cordova`, `nativescript`, `react-native`,
`expo`, or `mongodb`.
Also make sure to use your own host, port, username, password and database settings.

We added our Photo entity to the list of entities for this data source.
Each entity you are using in your connection must be listed there.

Setting `synchronize` makes sure your entities will be synced with the database, every time you run the application.

### Running the application

Now if you run your `index.ts`, a connection with the database will be initialized and a database table for your photos will be created.

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                         photo                           |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(100) |                            |
| description | text         |                            |
| filename    | varchar(255) |                            |
| views       | int(11)      |                            |
| isPublished | boolean      |                            |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

### Creating and inserting a photo into the database

Now let's create a new photo to save it in the database:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true

await AppDataSource.manager.save(photo)
console.log("Photo has been saved. Photo id is", photo.id)
```

Once your entity is saved it will get a newly generated id.
`save` method returns an instance of the same object you pass to it.
It's not a new copy of the object, it modifies its "id" and returns it.

### Using Entity Manager

We just created a new photo and saved it in the database.
We used `EntityManager` to save it.
Using entity manager you can manipulate any entity in your app.
For example, let's load our saved entity:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const savedPhotos = await AppDataSource.manager.find(Photo)
console.log("All photos from the db: ", savedPhotos)
```

`savedPhotos` will be an array of Photo objects with the data loaded from the database.

Learn more about EntityManager [here](./docs/working-with-entity-manager.md).

### Using Repositories

Now let's refactor our code and use `Repository` instead of `EntityManager`.
Each entity has its own repository which handles all operations with its entity.
When you deal with entities a lot, Repositories are more convenient to use than EntityManagers:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)

await photoRepository.save(photo)
console.log("Photo has been saved")

const savedPhotos = await photoRepository.find()
console.log("All photos from the db: ", savedPhotos)
```

Learn more about Repository [here](./docs/working-with-repository.md).

### Loading from the database

Let's try more load operations using the Repository:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const allPhotos = await photoRepository.find()
console.log("All photos from the db: ", allPhotos)

const firstPhoto = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
console.log("First photo from the db: ", firstPhoto)

const meAndBearsPhoto = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    name: "Me and Bears",
})
console.log("Me and Bears photo from the db: ", meAndBearsPhoto)

const allViewedPhotos = await photoRepository.findBy({ views: 1 })
console.log("All viewed photos: ", allViewedPhotos)

const allPublishedPhotos = await photoRepository.findBy({ isPublished: true })
console.log("All published photos: ", allPublishedPhotos)

const [photos, photosCount] = await photoRepository.findAndCount()
console.log("All photos: ", photos)
console.log("Photos count: ", photosCount)
```

### Updating in the database

Now let's load a single photo from the database, update it and save it:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const photoToUpdate = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
photoToUpdate.name = "Me, my friends and polar bears"
await photoRepository.save(photoToUpdate)
```

Now photo with `id = 1` will be updated in the database.

### Removing from the database

Now let's remove our photo from the database:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const photoToRemove = await photoRepository.findOneBy({
    id: 1,
})
await photoRepository.remove(photoToRemove)
```

Now photo with `id = 1` will be removed from the database.

### Creating a one-to-one relation

Let's create a one-to-one relationship with another class.
Let's create a new class in `PhotoMetadata.ts`. This PhotoMetadata class is supposed to contain our photo's additional meta-information:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    JoinColumn,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column("int")
    height: number

    @Column("int")
    width: number

    @Column()
    orientation: string

    @Column()
    compressed: boolean

    @Column()
    comment: string

    @OneToOne(() => Photo)
    @JoinColumn()
    photo: Photo
}
```

Here, we are using a new decorator called `@OneToOne`. It allows us to create a one-to-one relationship between two entities.
`type => Photo` is a function that returns the class of the entity with which we want to make our relationship.
We are forced to use a function that returns a class, instead of using the class directly, because of the language specifics.
We can also write it as `() => Photo`, but we use `type => Photo` as a convention to increase code readability.
The type variable itself does not contain anything.

We also add a `@JoinColumn` decorator, which indicates that this side of the relationship will own the relationship.
Relations can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
Only one side of relational can be owning.
Using `@JoinColumn` decorator is required on the owner side of the relationship.

If you run the app, you'll see a newly generated table, and it will contain a column with a foreign key for the photo relation:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                     photo_metadata                      |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| height      | int(11)      |                            |
| width       | int(11)      |                            |
| comment     | varchar(255) |                            |
| compressed  | boolean      |                            |
| orientation | varchar(255) |                            |
| photoId     | int(11)      | FOREIGN KEY                |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

### Save a one-to-one relation

Now let's save a photo, its metadata and attach them to each other.

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./entity/PhotoMetadata"

// create a photo
const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true

// create a photo metadata
const metadata = new PhotoMetadata()
metadata.height = 640
metadata.width = 480
metadata.compressed = true
metadata.comment = "cybershoot"
metadata.orientation = "portrait"
metadata.photo = photo // this way we connect them

// get entity repositories
const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const metadataRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(PhotoMetadata)

// first we should save a photo
await photoRepository.save(photo)

// photo is saved. Now we need to save a photo metadata
await metadataRepository.save(metadata)

// done
console.log(
    "Metadata is saved, and the relation between metadata and photo is created in the database too",
)
```

### Inverse side of the relationship

Relations can be unidirectional or bidirectional.
Currently, our relation between PhotoMetadata and Photo is unidirectional.
The owner of the relation is PhotoMetadata, and Photo doesn't know anything about PhotoMetadata.
This makes it complicated to access PhotoMetadata from the Photo side.
To fix this issue we should add an inverse relation, and make relations between PhotoMetadata and Photo bidirectional.
Let's modify our entities:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    JoinColumn,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.metadata)
    @JoinColumn()
    photo: Photo
}
```

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, OneToOne } from "typeorm"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./PhotoMetadata"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (photoMetadata) => photoMetadata.photo)
    metadata: PhotoMetadata
}
```

`photo => photo.metadata` is a function that returns the name of the inverse side of the relation.
Here we show that the metadata property of the Photo class is where we store PhotoMetadata in the Photo class.
Instead of passing a function that returns a property of the photo, you could alternatively simply pass a string to `@OneToOne` decorator, like `"metadata"`.
But we used this function-typed approach to make our refactoring easier.

Note that we should use the `@JoinColumn` decorator only on one side of a relation.
Whichever side you put this decorator on will be the owning side of the relationship.
The owning side of a relationship contains a column with a foreign key in the database.

### Relations in ESM projects

If you use ESM in your TypeScript project, you should use the `Relation` wrapper type in relation properties to avoid circular dependency issues.
Let's modify our entities:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    JoinColumn,
    Relation,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class PhotoMetadata {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.metadata)
    @JoinColumn()
    photo: Relation<Photo>
}
```

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToOne,
    Relation,
} from "typeorm"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./PhotoMetadata"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    /* ... other columns */

    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (photoMetadata) => photoMetadata.photo)
    metadata: Relation<PhotoMetadata>
}
```

### Loading objects with their relations

Now let's load our photo and its photo metadata in a single query.
There are two ways to do it - using `find*` methods or using `QueryBuilder` functionality.
Let's use `find*` methods first.
`find*` methods allow you to specify an object with the `FindOneOptions` / `FindManyOptions` interface.

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./entity/PhotoMetadata"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
const photos = await photoRepository.find({
    relations: {
        metadata: true,
    },
})
```

Here, photos will contain an array of photos from the database, and each photo will contain its photo metadata.
Learn more about Find Options in [this documentation](./docs/find-options.md).

Using find options is good and dead simple, but if you need a more complex query, you should use `QueryBuilder` instead.
`QueryBuilder` allows more complex queries to be used in an elegant way:

```javascript
import { Photo } from "./entity/Photo"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./entity/PhotoMetadata"
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

const photos = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
    .createQueryBuilder("photo")
    .innerJoinAndSelect("photo.metadata", "metadata")
    .getMany()
```

`QueryBuilder` allows the creation and execution of SQL queries of almost any complexity.
When you work with `QueryBuilder`, think like you are creating an SQL query.
In this example, "photo" and "metadata" are aliases applied to selected photos.
You use aliases to access columns and properties of the selected data.

### Using cascades to automatically save related objects

We can set up cascade options in our relations, in the cases when we want our related object to be saved whenever the other object is saved.
Let's change our photo's `@OneToOne` decorator a bit:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    /// ... other columns

    @OneToOne(() => PhotoMetadata, (metadata) => metadata.photo, {
        cascade: true,
    })
    metadata: PhotoMetadata
}
```

Using `cascade` allows us not to separately save photo and separately save metadata objects now.
Now we can simply save a photo object, and the metadata object will be saved automatically because of cascade options.

```javascript
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

// create photo object
const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.isPublished = true

// create photo metadata object
const metadata = new PhotoMetadata()
metadata.height = 640
metadata.width = 480
metadata.compressed = true
metadata.comment = "cybershoot"
metadata.orientation = "portrait"

photo.metadata = metadata // this way we connect them

// get repository
const photoRepository = AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)

// saving a photo also save the metadata
await photoRepository.save(photo)

console.log("Photo is saved, photo metadata is saved too.")
```

Notice that we now set the photo's `metadata` property, instead of the metadata's `photo` property as before. The `cascade` feature only works if you connect the photo to its metadata from the photo's side. If you set the metadata's side, the metadata would not be saved automatically.

### Creating a many-to-one / one-to-many relation

Let's create a many-to-one/one-to-many relation.
Let's say a photo has one author, and each author can have many photos.
First, let's create an `Author` class:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    Column,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    OneToMany,
    JoinColumn,
} from "typeorm"
import { Photo } from "./Photo"

@Entity()
export class Author {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @OneToMany(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.author) // note: we will create author property in the Photo class below
    photos: Photo[]
}
```

`Author` contains an inverse side of a relation.
`OneToMany` is always an inverse side of the relation, and it can't exist without `ManyToOne` on the other side of the relation.

Now let's add the owner side of the relation into the Photo entity:

```javascript
import { Entity, Column, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, ManyToOne } from "typeorm"
import { PhotoMetadata } from "./PhotoMetadata"
import { Author } from "./Author"

@Entity()
export class Photo {
    /* ... other columns */

    @ManyToOne(() => Author, (author) => author.photos)
    author: Author
}
```

In many-to-one / one-to-many relation, the owner side is always many-to-one.
It means that the class that uses `@ManyToOne` will store the id of the related object.

After you run the application, the ORM will create the `author` table:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                          author                         |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(255) |                            |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

It will also modify the `photo` table, adding a new `author` column and creating a foreign key for it:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                         photo                           |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| id          | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT |
| name        | varchar(255) |                            |
| description | varchar(255) |                            |
| filename    | varchar(255) |                            |
| isPublished | boolean      |                            |
| authorId    | int(11)      | FOREIGN KEY                |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

### Creating a many-to-many relation

Let's create a many-to-many relation.
Let's say a photo can be in many albums, and each album can contain many photos.
Let's create an `Album` class:

```javascript
import {
    Entity,
    PrimaryGeneratedColumn,
    Column,
    ManyToMany,
    JoinTable,
} from "typeorm"

@Entity()
export class Album {
    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()
    id: number

    @Column()
    name: string

    @ManyToMany(() => Photo, (photo) => photo.albums)
    @JoinTable()
    photos: Photo[]
}
```

`@JoinTable` is required to specify that this is the owner side of the relationship.

Now let's add the inverse side of our relation to the `Photo` class:

```javascript
export class Photo {
    /// ... other columns

    @ManyToMany(() => Album, (album) => album.photos)
    albums: Album[]
}
```

After you run the application, the ORM will create a **album_photos_photo_albums** _junction table_:

```shell
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
|                album_photos_photo_albums                |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
| album_id    | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |
| photo_id    | int(11)      | PRIMARY KEY FOREIGN KEY    |
+-------------+--------------+----------------------------+
```

Don't forget to register the `Album` class with your connection in the ORM:

```javascript
const options: DataSourceOptions = {
    // ... other options
    entities: [Photo, PhotoMetadata, Author, Album],
}
```

Now let's insert albums and photos to our database:

```javascript
import { AppDataSource } from "./index"

// create a few albums
const album1 = new Album()
album1.name = "Bears"
await AppDataSource.manager.save(album1)

const album2 = new Album()
album2.name = "Me"
await AppDataSource.manager.save(album2)

// create a few photos
const photo = new Photo()
photo.name = "Me and Bears"
photo.description = "I am near polar bears"
photo.filename = "photo-with-bears.jpg"
photo.views = 1
photo.isPublished = true
photo.albums = [album1, album2]
await AppDataSource.manager.save(photo)

// now our photo is saved and albums are attached to it
// now lets load them:
const loadedPhoto = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo).findOne({
    where: {
        id: 1,
    },
    relations: {
        albums: true,
    },
})
```

`loadedPhoto` will be equal to:

```javascript
{
    id: 1,
    name: "Me and Bears",
    description: "I am near polar bears",
    filename: "photo-with-bears.jpg",
    albums: [{
        id: 1,
        name: "Bears"
    }, {
        id: 2,
        name: "Me"
    }]
}
```

### Using QueryBuilder

You can use QueryBuilder to build SQL queries of almost any complexity. For example, you can do this:

```javascript
const photos = await AppDataSource.getRepository(Photo)
    .createQueryBuilder("photo") // first argument is an alias. Alias is what you are selecting - photos. You must specify it.
    .innerJoinAndSelect("photo.metadata", "metadata")
    .leftJoinAndSelect("photo.albums", "album")
    .where("photo.isPublished = true")
    .andWhere("(photo.name = :photoName OR photo.name = :bearName)")
    .orderBy("photo.id", "DESC")
    .skip(5)
    .take(10)
    .setParameters({ photoName: "My", bearName: "Mishka" })
    .getMany()
```

This query selects all published photos with "My" or "Mishka" names.
It will select results from position 5 (pagination offset)
and will select only 10 results (pagination limit).
The selection result will be ordered by id in descending order.
The photo's albums will be left joined and their metadata will be inner joined.

You'll use the query builder in your application a lot.
Learn more about QueryBuilder [here](./docs/select-query-builder.md).

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and

You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# warn-once

Print a warning exactly once during development. Suitable for deprecation warnings, warnings for missing setup etc.

## Installation

Open a Terminal in the project root and run:

```sh
npm install warn-once
```

## Usage

The `warnOnce` function accepts a condition as the first argument. If the condition is `true`, then it'll print a warning:

```js
const warnOnce = require('warn-once');

// ...

warnOnce(someCondition, 'This is a warning message');
```

You can call `warnOnce` multiple times, but if the warning was printed already, it'll not be printed again.

The warning is only shown during development, i.e. if `NODE_ENV` is not set to `'production'`.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

*Important*: [Blog post about future development](http://blog.arshaw.com/1/post/2013/03/xdate-08-and-future-development.html)
-------------------------------------------------

XDate
=====

A Modern JavaScript Date Library.

XDate is a thin wrapper around JavaScript's native
[Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
object and provides enhanced functionality for parsing, formatting, and manipulating dates.
It implements the same methods as the native Date, so it should seem very familiar.

Also, it is non-destructive to the DOM, so it can safely be included in third party libraries
without fear of side effects.
